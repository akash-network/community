## Notes

- Last sig-chain meeting for this year. Artur gave a recap of the year.
- All of the upgrades were successful. Only 1 small hiccup that was not upgraded related but consensus related for an emergency upgrade
- Right now the downtime during the upgrade is less than two minutes. Huge "Thank you" to everyone.
- There are quite a few network upgrades planned for next year. 3 upgrades planned for the first quarter. Please look in the support repo for more details.
- Small upgrades work better.
- First upgrade in the works right now is related to governance proposal periods. Right now you have wait 7 days. Artur is looking into expedited proposals. This has been implemented by Osmosis. Any type of proposal can be expedited, if 67 percent of voting power is made available if first 24 hours.
- There will be an upgrade that will include messaging for errors in lease.
- Packet forwarding is on the roadmap. This needs quite extensive testing. This will most likely be upgrade 3 for Q1 2024. All times are subject to change.

## Testing

- Scott and Artur are sweeping and auditing all end to end testing for network upgrades. All of the test sdls will be refactored.
- Anyone will be able to test.
- SDL will be moved away from node repo, and into AkashAPI.
- Testing have been steadily improving over the last year. This will continued to be improved.
- Test procedures will be in a separate repo. Will most likely use Docker compose. More to come here.

## Questions

- ZJ asked about Liquid staking. Is this on the Roadmap?
