## **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG Chain monthly meeting. It's January 14th, 2025. During the special interest group for the Akash blockchain, this group gets together monthly to discuss everything related to network upgrades, the Akash blockchain, validator relations, anything of that nature.  We have a couple of other meetings related to the core product where involved if they see any issues. you can get involved in SIG support as well as the support repo. but specifically again during this SIG chain we have it a little bit more often when we get closer to a network upgrade. but again this is a monthly just check-in meeting to discuss all things related to the Akash blockchain. Without further ado, I'll hand it over to Arur.

Tyler Wright: I know we're amidst test net 6 as we get prepare for the Akos network migration from Cosmos SDK 45 to 47. But I just want to see if there's anything that Archer specifically wanted to cover related to the Kosh blockchain orâ€¦

Tyler Wright: network upgrades or anything else.

Artur Troian: Thank you.

Artur Troian: Good morning everyone. all right. So test nets have been good success for us. right now we are still running test net 6. we plan to keep it online for probably next week or two.  So this moment we are working on the typescript part of the API just making sure that all of the proto generation and all of the new changes that introduced in this upgrade can be carried to the clients using typescript by console.

Artur Troian: team internally right now just pretty much does a lot of testing and migrations for the console. As soon as that part is done, I do anticipate it to be finished this week. we're going to start working on the migration guidelines for both Golang and  The item that is going on right now not quite a change dependent however the centralized cloud dependent we are m finishing migration of the codebase for provider to the new cotk as well as introducing couple key changes like deploy writer and once again anticipation of that to finish and be available as release candidate during this week

Artur Troian: As soon as we have that, we will be deploying a couple providers to the test net and give it a full test for integrations from the CLI parts from the console part and upon conclusion once we have results of this provider test we will be able to start upgrading the sandbox and give everybody pretty much general availability to test integrations on  the upcoming upgrade. I think that is it for me.

Tyler Wright: Thank you, again, as folks here and folks may be listening in later, there's a number of ways to get involved and contribute. Again, thanks to all those that participated in the first phase, test net 5, where we're testing our basic functionality of the Cosmos SDK 47 via the CLI and some basic commands. there was a number of folks from the community that helped to test that and again now that we're in test net six as Archer has mentioned there may be some additional need for participation from folks. so again The best place to look out for announcements if you're looking to contribute to the core is either by coming to this SIG chain meeting or by getting involved in Discord where you can see announcements across a number of different channels.

Tyler Wright: Other than that, I just want to see if there's anything else that anybody wanted to discuss as it relates to the Akash blockchain, network upgrades, validator relations, or anything of that Cool. if not, then again, look out for announcements in SIG Chain and various other channels in Discord. as we get closer and archer just outlined the next steps and I'll make sure the next steps are also available in the road map inside the Kosh network GitHub organization you can find it in the projects section but again as steps become closer we'll make sure there's updates in Discord and then look to get additional folks involved whether they're folks integrating with Akos or just folks looking


### 00:05:00

Tyler Wright: to test out further functionality. But much appreciate the update from Archer. thank you for everybody that joined here today and is listening later. And again, if anybody has any questions, there's a ticket that you can follow along with inside the GitHub organization. And again, I'll make sure it's in the notes and look forward to again seeing you all next month, if not sooner. Appreciate you all. Have a good rest of the day.

Scott Carruthers: Thanks everyone. Bye.
