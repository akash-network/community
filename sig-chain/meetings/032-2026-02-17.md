---

## Burn Mint Equilibrium (BME) Incentivized Testnet

### Launch Overview

* BME incentivized testnet officially began **February 17** and runs through **March 3, 2026**.
* Instructions, overview, and submission forms have been published and were shared again during the call.
* Reward pool: **$10,000** for participants who complete tasks correctly and meet eligibility requirements.

### Background & Preparation

* BME has undergone extensive community discussion since last year and was shaped through feedback on Akash Enhancement Proposals.
* Core engineering team internally tested BME functionality before involving Insiders.
* Insider testers successfully identified additional issues, which core team fixed before public release.

### Public Testnet Status

* The testnet plan, instructions, and submission system are now validated and active.
* Expected heavy validator and community participation.

### Official Resources for BME public testnet

* [Akash Burn Mint Equilibrium Incentivized Testnet Overview](https://akash.network/docs/testnet/overview/)
* [Akash Burn Mint Equilibrium Incentivized Testnet Testplan](https://akash.network/docs/testnet/testplan/)
* [Submission Form](https://forms.gle/MH1KxhNmoJxzMRfz9)
* Dedicated BME Incentivized Testnet Discord Channel for live support
* It is required to close all deployments to be eligible for prizes.

---

## Oracle Integration & Follow-Up Testing

### Current Phase

* The current incentivized testnet uses **manual price feeds**.

### Next Phase

* A follow-up internal testnet includes **Pyth oracle contracts**, which are already deployed and functioning successfully.
* There may be a **smaller public oracle testnet** to complement the main BME test phase.
* Oracle integration is part of a larger sequence of upcoming network upgrades.

---

## Validator Coordination & Network Upgrade Roadmap

Tyler outlined **three upcoming network upgrades**, all of which validators must prepare for:

### Upgrade One — Security Patch & Lease Close Fix

* Some validators performed manual patching in January.
* A full network-wide upgrade will formalize the fix.
* Also includes a fix to **lease_closed_reason**, important for Console and APIs.
* Expected to happen **within weeks**.

### Upgrade Two — Smart Contracts on Akash

* Brings first on-chain contract capabilities.
* Initially limited access; further enablement via governance parameter change.
* This upgrade is a critical prerequisite for BME final deployment.

### Upgrade Three — BME Activation

* Following the incentivized testnet + oracle testing + prior upgrades.
* Will formally activate BME on mainnet.
* Target timeline: **next couple of months**.

---

## Community Q&A

### Supporting External Developer Teams

* George asked about helping a team building a food delivery/consumer app migrate from AWS to Akash.
* Tyler clarified:

  * SIG Chain is not the best place for credit or onboarding programs.
  * Recommended starting with showing how Akash deployments work and identifying compute requirements.
  * Next steps can be handled via DM or discussions in appropriate Discord channels.

### Testnet Technical Requirements

* George asked if the BME testnet requires deep coding knowledge.
* Tyler and Scott clarified:

  * **No coding required**, but **command-line and Linux/MacOS familiarity** is needed.
  * Must use **Akash CLI**, not Console.
  * The test is fully CLI-driven and assumes basic system navigation skills.

### Participation Logistics

* All BME participants should join the dedicated Discord channel.
* Tyler will ensure George receives access to testnet notes and updates.

---

## Community Engagement & Closing Updates

* Internal testnet work continues for oracle and upcoming upgrades.
* Core team will review testnet submissions immediately after March 3, enabling quick reward distribution.
* Additional blockchain feature development is ongoing and will be discussed in upcoming sessions.
* Damir joined briefly to observe and offer support; no questions raised.

---

## Closing Remarks

* Tyler reiterated thanks to Insiders, validators, and early testers for helping BME preparation succeed.
* Meeting adjourned early as all agenda topics were covered.
* Follow-up SIG Chain meeting will include status check on upgrades and BME testing outcomes.

---

## Transcript


Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG Chain. It is Tuesday, February 17th, 2026. During the special interest group for chain or blockchain, the group goes through all things related to the Akash network blockchain. this involves validator relations as well as network upgrades and again anything blockchain related. I know there's a number of things that we want to quickly discuss today and I know a number of people are participating.

Tyler Wright: The big action item is the burn mint equilibrium incentivized test net began today, February 17th, and runs through March 3rd, 2026. I'm going to drop instructions that have been put together by the core team on overview of the BME test net. What is burn equilibrium for all those that don't know. and then again you can also see a test net plan that includes test net instructions as well as the submission form for those that want to participate.

Tyler Wright: Again, there are $10,000 in pool rewards paid for eligible participants that fill out correct answers and again meet the criteria for success. again this is an action item that has come a long way. There's been some bin burnment equilibrium.  This was talked about last year in the community. there was an Akash enhancement proposal that got some feedback from the community. I've been talking about this at SIG Economics as well as SIG chain. Leading into the new year, members of the Akash core engineering team put together tested that plan internally.

Tyler Wright: went through again testing the BME functionality, brought in a number of Akash insiders to do some extensive testing of the test net plan as well as a feature in totality. and again big shout out to folks that were part of that insider testing. They exposed a couple of additional issues that the core team has since fixed.  Now we're at the point where again the test net plan, the submission form, the overview plan have all been tested thoroughly by the core team as well as the community. And now again the BME public incentivized test net is underway through March 3rd.  After that, there is still some internal testing going on with the pricing oracle which u will be again part of a group of three network upgrades that are planned.

Tyler Wright: If you are a validator in the Akash ecosystem, if you're an Akash validator, again you should already have this information in Discord channel. If you're not in the Discord for Akash validator, but you are a validator and active set and feel free to reach out to myself, Tyler core team or any of the Akash insiders to make sure your roles are adjusted. but again there are three planned network upgrades on so a kosh core team the community have been very very busy.

Tyler Wright: the next network upgrade that is planned and this is ideally going to be more of an expedited network upgrade because it's not that big of a change but there was a security issue that a lot of the validators did some manual upgrading in January but there is again a public patch for all additional validators that will be enacted as well as an issue related to lease  closed. that was causing some issue related to console and some of the APIs that will be fixed and that is a network upgrade that is planned I believe for the next couple of weeks if not sooner. After that there is a network upgrade planned for bringing smart contracts onto Akash.

Tyler Wright: again this is a big part of the BME. but again smart contracts will be brought onto Akash and very limited access with again additional access for smart contracts being able to be unlocked by a parameter change and governance. and so that will be following the lease close network upgrade and then after that following again the BME incentivized test net additional testing and again those other two network upgrades that I just talked about there's a plan to bring the burn mint equilibrium implementation onto the Akash network and that'll be the third of three planned network upgrades happening over the next couple of months.


### 00:05:00

Tyler Wright: Those are the big items to really touch on today. Again, if anyone has any questions, you can ask in the sick change channel if you're watching this recording later. but the big action items are please participate in the BME incentivized test net. There is a public channel in discord which I will drop in the chat so that it is in the notes. but there is again a public channel for those that want that are participating in the BME incentivized test net where you can ask questions of the core team and insiders to get additional feedback or other users. and again then there's a number of network upgrades that I just talked about that are on the horizon for the Kosh community and validators.

Tyler Wright: Does anyone have any specific talking points that they want to make sure get discussed? I know we have a small group today.

Tyler Wright: Go ahead, I don't know if you had talked about

George Pro: Okay.

George Pro: I don't know if this is the right place to kind of discussion or the right place to ask about this. I have a team that actually want to build on a ship but It's an app that they want to build. full delivery apps. They have been trying to use AWS but I met them in an event and I told them they should come to Akash but I don't know if this is the right meeting to talk about this about…

George Pro: how they should go about they be able to get any credit available just like AWS does it and things like that.

Tyler Wright: So, George,…

Tyler Wright: Can you go into a little bit more detail? It's a group.

Tyler Wright: Can you say that one more time? I apologize. no. I was asking just repeat what you said one more time. You're saying it's What kind of group is it?

George Pro: Okay.

George Pro: So, I'm trying to say there's online event I went to and there's a team building on building food delivery app and consumer app. But what I realized is that there's not a lot of consumer app on a so I'm trying to see if there's a way we can kind of support them in terms of credit or technical support or any way we can kind of get them to aash.

George Pro: But I also don't know if this is the right place to talk about it.

Tyler Wright: This may not be the right sig to talk about it…

Tyler Wright: but I would just say just generally anybody that you come across from events always just show off the Akash network how to deploy the kinds of resources I'm not really sure what compute resources they have or have access to right now or…

George Pro: Sure.

Tyler Wright: deploying on. But that would be the best place to start to understand, the architecture and infrastructure. and then see if there's an opportunity for them to try to deploy, anything on the AOS network. and then from there, feel free to reach out to me in Discord and I can help with any, next discussion paths beyond that.

George Pro: I'll send you a DM.

Tyler Wright: Thank you, Again, I've dropped in some notes related to the test net overview for BMIN equilibrium as well as the test plan and…

Tyler Wright: the public Discord channel. I know that George here on the call does a great job of making the notes available. So, again, there's two weeks for this planned incentivized test net.

George Pro: It's Okay,…

Tyler Wright: After the test net is over, the core team will be reviewing other submissions and then looking to give out rewards pretty quickly after that because there's a number of other items that are on the horizon for the core engineering team related to blockchain and a couple of and many other things.


### 00:10:00

Tyler Wright: All right. is there any

George Pro: I have few more question also in terms of testing. I haven't really had time to kind of check what is really happening.  But then I want to know do you have to have some technical skills before you can participate in the testing?

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I do believe this test net does require technical skills because there is some coding that you will have to do. the instructions are made quite easy for folks to just be able to kind of copy and paste commands. go ahead, Scott.

Scott Carruthers: No, I completely agree with the path that you're going down. so I would just say the technical expertise I would say are general Linux skills. and maybe some familiarity with the Akash CLI. so there's no developing or coding necessary, but this isn't using Akash console at all. It's all test using the akash  CLI. So again, you would need to have knowledge of Linux or…

Scott Carruthers: using the command prompt on Mac OS. but it's all completely command line driven test. so it's not a very high technical hurdle. but you definitely do need to have some CLI experience.

George Pro: Thank you.

George Pro: Thank you.

Tyler Wright: George, did you have any other questions?

George Pro: All my question has been answered. Thank you.

Tyler Wright: Again for those that listening later feel free to participate in the BME incentivized test net that's happening from now until March 3rd. again we'll try to make these notes available pretty quickly. I'll make sure that George has access. cool deir sorry we were just about to drop off. We were just talking about the BME incentivized testnet work just began today and then looking forward a little bit to the next one around lease close and then security patch that many of the validators did manually in January.

Tyler Wright: And then followed by a network upgrade to bring smart contracts to the Akash network and then followed by a network upgrade to bring BME after the incentivized test net is complete and…

Tyler Wright: then additional work has been done by the core team. Any other questions that you had specifically or do you want to touch on as it pertains to anything sick chain related? I can't. you're fading in and out, but your mic was off or on. I think you're still having a mic issues.

Damir Simpovic: Thank you.

Damir Simpovic: Let's go to this. Can you hear me?

Tyler Wright: It may be me. I don't know if it's anybody else.

Scott Carruthers: Yeah, I'm hearing it as well, Yeah,…

Tyler Wright: Okay, cool.

Scott Carruthers: I'm not able to hear you either.

Tyler Wright: Yes. you faded out again.

Damir Simpovic: Just wanted to witness the meeting. That's all. I have no particular questions. this unique correct correct.

Tyler Wright: But you just wanted to join the meeting and say hello and if anybody needs any help, Damir  is here to help.

Damir Simpovic: Yes, something like that.

Tyler Wright: Amazing. All right, y'all.

Tyler Wright: again if there's no other questions then we could drop off a little early but feel free to get involved in Discord. There is a specific channel related to BME incentivized test 2026 where you can find instructions overview plan in submission form. But thank you to all those that are already testing all the insiders again the Akash core team members that helped bring this to fruition and we'll talk in a month as a followup and see where we are as it pertains to network upgrades. Thank you all. Have a great day.
