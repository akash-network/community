## Meeting Notes

- **Opening and Context**
  - Tyler Wright opened the meeting, welcoming everyone to the October 2025 Chain SIG session.  
  - The focus was on the **Akash Mainnet 14 network upgrade (Proposal #308)**, scheduled for **October 28, 2025, at 8:00 AM Central Time (13:00 UTC)** if the vote passes.  
  - The upgrade moves Akash from **Cosmos SDK v0.47 to v0.53**, a major milestone involving several state-breaking and performance enhancements.  

- **Network Upgrade Overview**
  - The proposal has been published on-chain and is open for validator voting.  
  - The upgrade aims to bring **faster queries, streamlined governance**, and **expedited proposal handling** for urgent matters.  
  - Two major AEPs were discussed:  
    - **AEP-75:** Multi-depositor escrow accounts.  
    - **AEP-839:** To be implemented post-upgrade.  
  - The core team has engaged in **extensive testing** across CLI and other tools to ensure stability.  
  - Validators and exchanges are being informed and assisted with upgrade preparations.  

- **Upgrade Timeline & Process**
  - Network downtime is expected to last **60–90 minutes** while blocks are paused during the migration.  
  - **Snapshots** will be made available for validators with slower infrastructure to facilitate easier upgrades.  
  - Binaries are still under final review and expected to be released by **Friday or Saturday (October 24–25)**.  
  - The **node upgrade guide** has been published for validators, exchanges, and infrastructure operators via [Akash Docs](https://akash.network/docs/mainnet-14-upgrade/node-upgrade-guide/).  

- **Validator Coordination & Communication**
  - Validators not yet in the **private validator Discord channel** or **email list** were encouraged to join before the upgrade.  
  - Tyler emphasized tagging **himself or Zeke Ezagui** to ensure all validators are added to the private channels.  
  - If a **war room** session becomes necessary during the upgrade, it will be hosted in the private validator chat.  

- **Technical Recommendations**
  - Validators were advised to **set pruning = "nothing"** before the upgrade to speed up migration.  
  - Most validators using **Cosmizer** will experience smoother processes and easier debugging than those using custom setups.  
  - Infrastructure teams have been testing for performance consistency across various setups.  

- **Governance and Voting**
  - All participants were reminded to **vote on Proposal #308** as soon as possible to avoid last-minute delays.  
  - The proposal details, including block height countdowns, are visible on **Mintscan** at [Proposal #308](https://www.mintscan.io/akash/proposals/308/).  

- **Community Communication**
  - A major focus is on **clear public communication** during the upgrade window.  
  - The **Akash website** will display a banner indicating upgrade progress and offline functionality.  
  - During the upgrade, **active leases** will continue to operate normally, but **new lease deployments** will be unavailable.  
  - Some sections of the website (e.g., the staff page) may be temporarily unavailable.  
  - Offline mode and communication features are being implemented to ensure users remain informed.  

- **Validator Outreach**
  - Validators are urged to connect with peers and ensure readiness.  
  - Everyone is encouraged to **spread upgrade awareness** across Discord and social platforms.  
  - The core team will continue coordinating across **Discord, social channels, and validator networks** to ensure smooth upgrade execution.

## **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All Welcome everybody to SIG Chain monthly meeting. It's October 21st, 2025. During the special interest group for the chain or blockchain, the group gets together to talk about all things related to the blockchain. specifically around validator relations anything that you see on anybody that sees on mainet related to the blockchain and network upgrades. Obviously there's been a proposal that had gone t on chain from the core team as it pertains to the network upgrade. again that proposal is linked proposal number 308 for AOS mainet 14 version 1.0.0.

Tyler Wright: I know the core team has been working tirelessly along with members of the community to get this upgrade ready from client standpoint testing a number of functionalities across again CLI and otherwise and I know many of those efforts are ongoing. again if you have the ability to vote on this proposal please read the proposal and vote at your earliest convenience.  If the proposal passes, the network upgrade is scheduled for next Tuesday, October 28th, around 8 a.m. Central time. Again, the countdown time is usually approximated so again inside the network proposal, you can see a countdown to the block height in which the network upgrade will happen.

Tyler Wright: and you can see a approximate countdown to that time frame as the vote continues to push and the network upgrade is getting closer.  again myself and others from the core team will make sure to reach out to validators and other members of the community so that they can have a more approximate time if there are any active validators in and the active set that are not currently in the private validators Discord channel or are not on the email list again please anybody on this call or anybody that has access if you see anybody out there please tag

Tyler Wright: tag me or Zeke from the core team and we can make sure that those folks get added to the private chat ahead of the network upgrade. Again, if there's any war room that has to get done amongst validators, that's where the conversation will happen. as you can see from the Minscan proposal, again there's a number of changes coming in this network upgrade if it passes. but again getting from Kasos SDK 47 to now version 0.53 has been quite the endeavor and again the idea is that there'll be faster queries streamline proposals for urgent matters. So instead of having a 7-day governance proposal period again there will be cases in which an expedited governance proposal can be enacted and again the chain can move quicker on some items.

Tyler Wright: There's a couple of apes that are affecting other programs like tips and other items that were state breaking changes and again those things will be brought into this AP75 around multi- depositor escro accounts and then 839 will also be implemented post network Again this network upgrade is a cash mainet 14.

Tyler Wright: so again, there's a lot that's been going on obviously over the years and continuing to improve the product. I've dropped in, you can find in the notes as well. the core team has put together a node upgrade guide for, validators, centralized exchanges, etc. that, again, There's no action on the upgrade side right now. Again, the binaries are not even available quite yet.  they will be available closer to the end of the week just in case there's any last minute items that need to get adjusted. there's just one set of binaries that goes out to the community so there's no confusion. So look out for that closer to Friday Saturday. No, there's a number of items that could be talked about as pertains to the mainet 14 upgrade.

Tyler Wright: but again there is detailed breakdown the proposal on what's being changed how folks can kind of change it. There's been announcements made across Discord reached out to a number of core validators have talked to centralized exchanges. The community has gotten involved in helping to test a number of functionality across CLI and elsewhere.  And so again, there's just been a real community effort to get to Akos mainet 14. So I just want to shout out everybody that's been identifying issues, been looking at things, testing things. so yeah, I know there's a lot going on as it pertains to the timing.


### 00:05:00

Tyler Wright: the testing right now around the expected duration for the network to be network downtime where blocks aren't being produced is around 60 to 90 minutes. again the core team has been working with validators with different infrastructure types to test out how long the upgrade will take. there are some snapshots that will be available to those that again may not have the infrastructure to quickly do an upgrade and they may just use the snapshot. So the core team is again strategizing and going to have a number of different avenues for people to upgrade but please look at the network upgrade instructions.

Tyler Wright: hopefully most people use Cosmizer. so again this should be fairly straightforward. I do want to remind folks that haven't done it. again this is be done sooner closer to the upgrade but asking folks and I'll remind folks closer to please set pruning equal to nothing. this is something that again we've identified from past network upgrades that expedites the process.  I know I have been talking a fair amount about the network upgrade. I just want to see if anybody had any questions as it pertains to the network upgrade timing testing anything like that that they want to ask in front of the group right now and get some more clarity on.

Tyler Wright: All right. I would just ask on this call, anybody that sees any items in Discord, please just direct people to understand that network upgrades is coming soon. for those that can, please do vote. I know the console team and the team work on the website are going to have implemented an offline mode. so again when the network upgrade is happening again active leases will continue to live on during that time period it'll be difficult for people to deploy new leases during that 60 to mid 90 minute approximate time frame.

Tyler Wright: so again there will be some offline functionality. I know the staff page may not be working properly during that network upgrade time. the website will have a ticker on the top announcement bar that'll talk let people know the network upgrade is happening.  So again, the idea is to communicate the network upgrade to as many folks as possible so that folks can plan ahead and not be confused when things aren't acting as they normally do during that time period. But again, first order of business is for folks that have the ability to vote to vote because again, this mainet 14 upgrade will only happen if the vote passes.

Tyler Wright: So, does anyone have any specific questions or comments about anything network upgrade related? All right. I know again that's the major focus for this meeting.  pushed it back a week. while the core team has been again very very much heads down on this Kazos SDK 53 migration and AOS mainet 14. I just want to see outside of the network upgrade again and talk about validator relations and preparing validators for that.

Tyler Wright: if there's any validators who are not in Discord in the validators channel or not on the email list and they want to please have them reach out to me and I can make sure that they're either added to the channel andor added to the email list for validation active set. And please again if just prepare yourself mentally and physically for that time.  that time is trying to make it as easy for people all across the world to be online and be responsive just in case there's any issues and a roll back is needed. Cool. All right.


### 00:10:00

Tyler Wright: outside of the network upgrade, I just want to see if there's any other topics that anybody wants to discuss as pertains to the blockchain or validator relations. All right. If not, then certainly we can adjourn a little bit early. again please stay connected in Discord. Look out for announcements across social media. Again connect with other folks in the Akos community and remind them the network upgrade is happening. ators again check in with other validators that you may know and just continue to remind them and make sure that they're prepared for the network upgrade.

Tyler Wright: Again, we want to get as many people at Cosmizer as possible because it's easier to debug versus people that have their own custom validator setups. So, again, much appreciate everyone's time attentiveness. please vote if you haven't already. and then from there again we should be tracking towards a network upgrade next Tuesday around 8:00 a.m.  Central time 1300 UTC. and again we'll meet in Discord and stay connected there. and hoping and knocking on wood for a smooth and easy network upgrade. Awesome. all again if anybody has any questions please drop them in the validators chat as pertains to network upgrade or SIG chain channel.

Tyler Wright: If anybody has any other topics that they want to discuss across other items, just please put them in public channels. and again, much appreciate everyone's time, attention, and involvement today. Thank you all very much.

Joao Luna: Thank you.

Tyler Wright: You all next Tuesday.

Rodri R: You guys.
