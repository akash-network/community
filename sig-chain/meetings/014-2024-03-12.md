## Meeting Notes
### Introduction and Updates
#### Tyler Wright
- Tyler Wright welcomed everyone to the Sig Chain monthly meeting #14.
- The meeting focuses on the Akash blockchain, Cosmos SDK, governance proposals, and network upgrades.
- Validators and community members are encouraged to join and participate.
- Tyler acknowledged the efforts of validators in voting on proposals.
- Currently, there are three active proposals onchain.
- A recently passed proposal concerns decreasing minimum deposits for deployments and transactions on the tenant and provider sides.
- This change has been tested and is functioning correctly.
##### Active Proposals:
  - Highlighted the community and spheron team's contributions to recent discussions leading to parameter changes.
  - Specifically mentioned an important active proposal regarding the main upgrade to version 0.332.0.
    - Voting for this proposal is ending soon, within the next few hours.
    - If passed, a network upgrade is scheduled for tomorrow at 12:37 Eastern Time (UTC conversion to be provided).
- **Network Upgrade Discussion**
  - **Tyler Wright**
    - Core engineering team led by Artur Troian.
    - Messaging about the upgrade will be shared on various channels.
    - Documentation updated and available on the docs site.
    - Information will be disseminated through Discord and other platforms.
  - **Artur Troian**
    - Upgrade expected to be quick and easy, minimal downtime.
    - Reminder about the US daylight savings time shift; upgrade at 1pm EST.
    - First network upgrade of the year, a minor but important change.
    - Anticipation for more upgrades later in the year.
    - Plan to present and discuss future proposals and enhancements.
    - Encouragement for feedback on blockchain improvements.
- **Network Upgrade Discussion (Continued)**
  - **Rodrigo Rochin**
    - Asked about the lowering of provider AP requirements.
    - Queried if it is now cheaper to deploy and have providers.
  - **Tyler Wright**
    - Confirmed the parameter change from 5 AKT to 0.5 AKT for both provider and deployer sides.
    - Proposal 248 outlines the changes.
    - Clarified that the parameter change has been tested but defaults to 5 AKT and needs manual adjustment.
  - **Scott Carruthers**
    - In the process of testing the provider side for the bid minimum deposit.
    - Deployment creation using 0.5 AKT is working perfectly.
    - Mentioned the need to use a deposit switch when creating deployments via Akash CLI, which defaults to 5 AKT.
    - Cloudmos team can set the default to 0.5 AKT on their platform.
    - Announcements will be made once provider side testing is complete.
- **Core Engineering Team and Contributions**
  - **Tyler Wright**
    - The core engineering team is growing with significant community contributions.
    - Focus on managing more engineering tasks related to the core product.
    - Network upgrades and Sig Chain projects to be included in the product and engineering roadmap.
    - Items will be tagged in the backlog section for easy access.
    - Aim for transparency and communication through roadmap discussions.
- **Network Upgrade Clarifications**
  - **Scott Carruthers**
    - Clarified the adjustment lowering provider attribute update prices as part of the network upgrade scheduled for tomorrow.
    - Lowering of minimum bid and deployment deposits (already in effect due to a proposal passed yesterday) is separate from the provider attribute update fee reduction.
  - **Artur Troian**
    - Will release a new CLI version after the network upgrade to include updated default values.
    - Historically, the CLI used hardcoded default parameters, but the new release will query the current default bid and deployment deposits if not set manually.
  - **Maxime Beauchamp**
    - Cloudmos updated to query on-chain parameters, setting the default to 0.5 AKT.

## Action Items
- Validators and participants are reminded to vote on the active proposal if they haven't already.
- Group to prepare for the planned network upgrade scheduled for tomorrow if the proposal passes.
- Tyler to attach Proposal 248 for Rodrigo.
- Scott to complete provider side testing and communicate the results.
- Cloudmos team to potentially adjust the default deployment parameter to 0.5 AKT.
