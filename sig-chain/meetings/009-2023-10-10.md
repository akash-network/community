- Authorization issue was found after upgrade related to the upgrade. 
- Two upgrade are coming very soon. Artur and the core team want to have upgrades 
- The first upgrade will be around bid attributes. The client may want to know what provider office hours. Bid message is perfect place to this information.

- Artur mentioned that the naming of fee abstraction may be wrong. Fee abstraction is something different. 
- ICQ is not ready to be used right now. We cannot rely on it right now.
- Cross currency swap is still something that is interesting. Really narrow use case.
