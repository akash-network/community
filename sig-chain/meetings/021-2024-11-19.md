## Transcript


Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG chain monthly meeting. Believe this is number 23 or 24. this special interest group for the chain focuses on all things related to the Akash blockchain network upgrades validator relations again all things blockchain related.  We have a number of other SIGs like SIG support where we talk about more specific technical issues related to products whether it be the blockchain or Akash console. But again here we talk about network upgrades some of the bigger concepts.

Tyler Wright: One of the things that's been going on lately, and I'll pass it off to Artur and Scott and some others that have been involved is again we're continuing to track towards a network upgrade that implements a migration from Cosmos SDK45 to Cosmos SDK47. This is something that the core engineering team has been working on for really months at this point. There's been a proposal that has passed on chain.  We've been talking to validators making sure that their infrastructure is ready for the network upgrade. and then again there's been a lot of development work that's going on and testing that involves members of the community. I know we're amidst testing phase one.

Tyler Wright: and again there's been a number of people from the community that have been participating but I'll hand it over to Archer and Scott who have been working extensively on the development process as we migrate from 45 to 47 and the test net which is happening right now.  So, I'll pass it off to Archer first and then I'm sure Scott can give us a quick update on test net 5 and some of the next steps.

Artur Troian: Thank you, I'll try to be quite quick here. So, we've been doing quite extensive testing and we have quite a small test net running and it's been going so far good. I'll let Scott to give details on that. but it seems to be we are wrapping it up and going to start switching to the more widespread test net to allow test for the clients. just to make sure that everybody's aware here, this upgrade brings quite a substantial amount of API changes both coming from the Cosmos SDK as well as internally from the car team and we need to make sure that all the integrations are working smoothly.

Artur Troian: So they're going to have to write migrations and the next test phase will be focused on those migrations and all of the clients including centralized exchanges existing integrations like terraform and so on so forth working as flawless as possible. So the next phase is going to be quite long. One of the reasons is the API changes. The second one is the provider changes. we are working on the provider upgrade in the background to this at this moment and hopefully maybe in a couple weeks we should be able to release first risk candidates and start running the providers on the upgraded test net but I think that will be wrapped up on this one.

Artur Troian: yeah, sorry to summarize, we won't be doing the upgrade this year just because of it so massive and we are entering holiday season which gives us more breathing room in the testing. So about the actual upgrade we will be coming back to the subject early next year.  Scott take it away.

Scott Carruthers: So testnet 5 and the testing of the Cosmos SDK47 upgrade has gone very smoothly. So we have a number of insiders a couple of them are on this call and Zeke and Rodri who have been helping the test. So this been rather exhaustive testing across the entire AOS CLI. so I gave instructions. these aren't just spot checks, but the methodology we came up with is actually very exhaustively testing all different modules and the related CLI commands for transactions and queries for those different modules. So when I say modules for anyone that's not aware the deployment module, the market module and all bank modules and all these different modules we've very thoroughly tested.

Scott Carruthers: so the testing has gone very well across AOC CLI testing. We've also done exhaustive gRPC testing. we've also done exhaustive REST API testing. and also some ancillary features that we wanted to make sure were going to be functional post upgrade. so I initially built a validator on the testnet network. Zeke actually built two more validators and joined them to the test net network.  So we have validation that consensus is working across three equally st validators. so for every block that's written two out of those three validators need to come to consensus. very thoroughly tested consensus. and also I've done some other testing of state sync and I tested state sync late last week and state sync is working flawlessly as well on the upgraded version. so there's been very few issues that have been discovered within testn net.


### 00:05:00

Scott Carruthers: late last week we had an issue where the Cosmos SDK is largely deprecating Amino JSON transactions were working with direct signing mode but we're not working with Amino JSON and we needed to fix that for some backward compatibility. so that's just off the top of my head there's been one or two issues like that very quickly resolved and a new version was cut and released and now that issue has resolved so any issues that have come up in test net have immediately been rectified and I'm not aware of any outstanding issues. Testnet 5 has been pretty targeted. We're really only testing the node codebase at this point.

Scott Carruthers: So future test nets will do full stack testing of the blockchain and providers but this was purely focused on the node repository and blockchain functionality. so yeah huge thanks to all the insiders that have been testing this and so far we've discovered very few issues so we're in great shape.

Tyler Wright: Thank you, does anyone have any questions about the next steps the network upgrade in general or some of the testing from phase one?  Again, over the next couple weeks, I'll continue to remind validators about infrastructure requirements for this next network upgrade. because again, it's just a massive upgrade. just want to make sure that everyone's resources, at least the next network upgrade, meet the minimum requirements so it can be as smooth as things have been in the past.

Tyler Wright: testing will continue as mentioned by Archer and Scott over the next couple of weeks, month in terms of client testing, additional testing of again various parts and various other integrations. If anybody wants to get involved in continuing to test things over time, feel free to just drop a message in SIG chain.  Again, it'll be mostly focused on a number of the clients and client teams that will be a part of this next phase. But if anybody, wants to test anything that they've been working on and get ready for the network upgrade, again, please drop a note in SIG chain and folks can u be added to whatever that environment is.

Tyler Wright: Does anyone have any other talking points that they want to bring up at this point related to network upgrades, Akash blockchain or anything like that? If not, then just from a scheduling point, as Artur mentioned, we're getting into the holiday season.  There' there's a number of things already in motion as it pertains to the next phases. So for sync chain monthly meeting in December we may just keep it async unless there's an action item where again we'll look out for announcements there as we head into again this very very busy holiday season with a lot going on.

Tyler Wright: But again if anybody wants to get involved in testing wants access to the testnet 5 environment while it's still up please reach out and then again as we move into phase two I'm sure there will be opportunities for folks if they need to get access to that environment to do any testing that they may need.  So again, always feel free to drop a note in SIG chain reach out to myself or another member of the core team and we can help with next steps. Anything else anybody wants to discuss before I let y'all go?

Tyler Wright: 

Tyler Wright: Otherwise, again, you can have some time back and we can reconnect async in and during using the SIG chain discord channel and look out for next instructions in terms of test nets, meetings, etc. All right. much appreciate updates from Artur and Scott. Thank you to all those that have been participating in phase one of this testnet 5 and doing a fair amount of testing of the Much appreciated. Certainly we'll follow up with you soon. And again, thank you to everybody who's listening in who joined here today. Hope everyone has a great day.
