## Notes

- First sig-chain of 2024. Happy new year.
- There are some proposals on chain for vote. Please vote if you can. 
- First network upgrade will be for changing governance proposal structure. Osmosis already has a version of this implemented. No Testnet is needed for this. This will be tested by the core team, and a newtwork upgrade will happen.
- Proposal 2 will be related to Akash marketplace. Right now it is hard to know why a lease has been closed.
- Network Upgrade 3 will be around packet forwarding. Code base is done. Feature just needs to be tested extensively.
