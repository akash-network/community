- Artur talked about parameters for governance proposals. 
- Cosmos SDK
- One migration that will combine those things. 
- All validators commissions will be minimum 5%.

- Artur is waiting for CosmosSDK 45.15. He has been speaking with Cosmos maintainers, and this should be updated this week. 
- One change is IBC go. We are on an outdated version, so we need to upgrade. 
- Artur talked about issue #20
- Changes from the next upgrade live in the [akash node repo here](https://github.com/akash-network/node/compare/master...develop)
- There are two ways to do an upgrade. First way is through the governance proposal. Second path is through a hard fork. Many chains including Juno and Osmosis do this for certain circumstances.
