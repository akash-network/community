- **Upcoming Cosmos SDK 47 Upgrade:**
  - Artur Troian discussed expedited governance proposals, allowing execution within 24 hours if consensus over 66% is reached.
  - Realization that Cosmos SDK 47 already includes this feature led to the decision to migrate to SDK 47.

  - Target timeline: aiming for completion by end of summer, with actual upgrade likely in autumn.
  - Preparations for future SDK 50 upgrades also discussed.
  - Emphasis on providing reference designs in GoLang and TypeScript for developers.

  - Opportunities for community involvement in testing will be available.
  - Smaller upgrades planned for the end of the year will be on hold.
  - Significant post-upgrade improvements expected.
  - Encouragement to use the product and engineering roadmap for tracking and communication.
  - Monthly meetings will continue, with the duration depending on the updates available.
  - Final call for any additional topics or questions.
