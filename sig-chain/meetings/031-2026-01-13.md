## Meeting Notes

### Opening Remarks & SIG-Chain Scope

* Tyler Wright welcomed participants to the January SIG-Chain monthly meeting
* He clarified that SIG-Chain focuses on Akash blockchain protocol topics
* Areas of focus include validator relations, network upgrades, and core chain functionality
* Tyler distinguished SIG-Chain from provider and node-focused engineering syncs
* Context was provided that the previous SIG-Chain meeting took place in November

### Context From Previous Updates

* Tyler referenced the prior update from Artur covering the Cosmos SDK v53 migration post-mortem
* Smart contracts and the upcoming BME were identified as the next major milestones
* December did not include a SIG-Chain meeting due to holidays and engineering focus

### Engineering Update – Smart Contracts, Oracle, and BME

* Artur Troian provided a comprehensive update on core protocol progress
* He confirmed that development work on smart contracts, Oracle, and BME was completed before the new year
* These features require careful implementation due to pricing correctness and network impact
* The Oracle module is critical for accurate price feeds and cannot be rushed
* The team reviewed other ecosystem implementations to avoid known pitfalls

### Testing Status and Code Readiness

* Internal testing of smart contracts and price feeder functionality has been conducted
* Oracle pricing was confirmed to be functioning correctly in internal tests
* The Oracle module is considered feature complete, with further bugs potentially identified during testing
* BME is also feature complete from a functionality standpoint
* Artur noted that BME required significant redesign of core blockchain “plumbing”
* Changes impacted deployments, the marketplace, and APIs
* The scope of these changes extended development timelines beyond initial estimates
* All related code was published and entered the release process as of the prior week

### Testnet Phases and Community Participation

* An internal testnet is currently being set up by the core team
* The goal of phase one is to identify critical bugs before public exposure
* Scott Carruthers is actively working on integrating Oracle pricing for BME testing
* Once phase one completes, the team will move to phase two
* Phase two will be a public, incentivized testnet open to the community
* Final participant requirements are still being defined
* Details and instructions will be published once finalized
* Tyler Wright will act as the primary coordination point for the testnet

### Network Upgrade Strategy

* Artur explained that Oracle and BME will be released in two separate network upgrades
* The first upgrade will introduce the Oracle module only
* This allows the network to validate Oracle stability and price accuracy on mainnet
* Once confidence is established, the BME upgrade will be triggered
* The BME upgrade is more complex due to changes in escrow and marketplace data structures

### BME Design and Fallback Mechanism

* BME introduces support for multiple pricing mechanisms
* A fallback mechanism is implemented to ensure uninterrupted deployments
* Deployments will include both AKT-per-block and USDC-per-block pricing
* If the BME circuit breaker triggers, deployments continue using AKT pricing
* Once resolved, payments automatically transition to USDC
* This design ensures continuity even during market or oracle disruptions

### Governance and Smart Contract Deployment

* Jannick H asked whether smart contracts would be permissioned
* Artur confirmed that the current model requires governance proposals for contract upload
* Only the governance module is whitelisted for contract deployment and instantiation
* The possibility of whitelisting additional addresses was discussed
* Multisig-based whitelisting could allow faster upgrades if approved via governance
* The team acknowledged trade-offs between flexibility and governance control
* Further discussion is expected to continue on GitHub

### Announcements, Validator Communication, and Closing

* Tyler confirmed that validators will be notified via Discord and email lists
* Announcements will cover testnet phases and upcoming network upgrades
* Community members were encouraged to help stress-test BME before mainnet deployment
* Tyler thanked Artur and the core engineering team for their work
* Participants exchanged New Year greetings
* The meeting concluded with appreciation and reminders of upcoming SIGs and working groups

## Action Items

### Artur Troian

* Oversee internal testnet completion for Oracle and BME
* Coordinate phased network upgrade strategy
* Continue evaluation of smart contract governance and whitelisting options

### Tyler Wright

* Coordinate validator and community communications for testnets and upgrades
* Publish announcements for phase one and phase two testnets
* Act as primary point of contact for SIG-Chain updates

### Core Engineering Team

* Complete internal testing and bug identification
* Prepare public incentivized testnet requirements
* Ensure Oracle stability before triggering BME upgrade

### Community Members and Validators

## **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All welcome everybody to SIG Chain monthly meeting. It is January 13, 2026. during the special interest group for the blockchain, the group gets together to talk about all things related to the AOS blockchain. It usually includes validator relations, network upgrades, and anything related to the core blockchain. again there's also another special interest group where from the overclock labs the core engineering team on the network gets together at six supports where they talk about issues related to the provider and node repo. but again during this network during this s chain the group gets together and talks about all things related to just the Akash network blockchain and network upgrades in general.

Tyler Wright: At our last meeting which was in November Archer gave an update as it pertains to kind of a post-mortem for the Kazos SDK 53 migration and talked a little bit about BME which is the next major item.  He also talked a little bit about smart contracts. Again, the core engineering team was heads down in December and with the short month, I don't believe there was a meeting. but I'm going to hand over to Arter to give us updates on smart contracts on Akash as well as BME and I think some impending network upgrades which are on the horizon.

Tyler Wright: Archer, if you're speaking, you might be on mute.

Artur Troian: Sorry.

Artur Troian: Please.

Tyler Wright: Yes, sir.

Artur Troian: All righty. hello everyone.  It's been a while since we had given updates on what's going on with the progress and apologies for that. It's kind of lined up with the holidays and we kind of wanted to give team a little break. but yeah so kind of two major items right now on the table that's smart contracts along with the oracle and BME.

Artur Troian: So we have kind of completed the code I think right before the new year and those features are nice that's one of the reasons why we have a little device here the both of them have to be implemented quite carefully because Oracle module is definitive in terms of providing the correct pricing  and just implement it sort of quickly. We need to consider a lot of items, look into other implementations just to make sure that we don't hit the issues and challenges that other teams have had in the past.

Artur Troian: so I think we have given a little bit of internal testings in terms of the smart contracts and the pricing via price feeder was working fine and at this point the Oracle module kind of looks feature complete but there might be some bugs revealed during testing. the BME part has been feature complete as well.

Artur Troian: But the challenge here is that feature changes a lot of I like to use the word plumbing here around the marketplace and that it touches deployments, it touches marketplace and obviously the API.  So we had to spend a lot of time redesigning some of the key modules within Akash blockchain and that's why the BME itself was taking us slightly longer than we initially thought it would be. anyways I think as of last week we have published all the codes and kind of going through the releases process.

Artur Troian: Right now we have internal test net that is being kind of set up and we do initial run internally in terms of find out any kind of rude bugs that may kind of be an obstacle during the public test net.  and Scott Crowers right now is in progress of hooking up the Oracle pricing do the initial testing for the BME and so on so forth as soon as this phase one% complete and once again it depends if we find any bugs it can be tomorrow it can next week we will be transitioning to the phase two where everybody from the community can participate and kind of earn some so some make a key on


### 00:05:00

Artur Troian: So that's going to be the incentivized portion of the test net. We are still working on what we expect participants to do and as soon as we kind of finalize the requirements, we will publish them for everybody. and I think in terms of the organization, Tyler will be the first person to be contacted regarding the test net. but if you see a lot of people, we might, hook up a couple more team members to help us with that. in terms of what's next, we need to perform extremely thorough testing of both Oracle and the BME.

Artur Troian: So right now Oracle and the BME are kind of combined together within the code base in the blockchain but we want it to be released into two separate stages. Very first stage will be just the oracle.  So we will release the do network upgrade connect Oracle modules and start collecting AT price making sure that the oracle is stable and performs as intended on the mainet as soon as we have that confidence we will trigger the BME network upgrade.

Artur Troian: The BME upgrade will be slightly heavier than the Oracle and the reason why is we have to change data structures within the deployment escrow and marketplace and the main trigger for this change is support for multiple prices so what happens is if let's say the BME circuit breaker

Artur Troian: triggers when SC stops minking users still want to keep deploying and paying for their workloads. So we have implemented what's called fallback mechanism as a specification for the BME which means when deployment has been created it will provide two prices it will provide the AK price in the AKT per block and in the ACT per block.  So then if let's say the circle breaker trips and somebody creates deployments that deployment initially will start paying the AKC until circle breaker resolves and then it will automatically transition to be in the act.

Artur Troian: I think that's pretty much it for near future and I believe this kind those updates will be sort of circle back on the next C chain because I believe by that time we might have at least one of great but I can't promise for sure at this point. Any questions? Okay. …

Artur Troian: I think that covers it. Tyler, back to you.

Tyler Wright: Perfect. Thank you,…

Tyler Wright: Again, there'll be a number of announcements made around phases for phase one internal test net, what results from that. and then instructions for again phase two. and all validators will be alerted in Discord as well as those that are on the email list as we prepare for again two upcoming network upgrades. Go ahead, Yanik.

Jannick H: Yeah. hi. I'm not sure if this has been covered yet, but will the cosmos be permissioned via guff crops?

Artur Troian: So, sorry, I didn't get it. Could you please circle back?

Jannick H: So they are usually governance on Osmosis you need to be whitelisted to upload contracts to the


### 00:10:00

Artur Troian: 

Artur Troian: Yeah. so the limitations remaining pretty much the same as we defined them initially. smart contracts will only be applauded via governance. I don't know at this point we have a couple kind of things to talk about and I think we might trigger a discussion on the GitHub for that.  So right now the plan is that smart contract will be deployed and instantiated via governance proposals. It has all of the only governance module can be whitelisted. U we could add whit listed addresses I think probably through the multise maybe. once again those can be updated with your governance proposal.

Artur Troian: So there is a good reason to kind of both approaches and I think the having and white listed for example multise creates ability to upload smart contracts and update them much quicker than we would do it with the governance and I get the point here. so yeah once again we kind of have a main mechanism in place via governance proposal and in terms of the white list that's white listed the address it's kind of in talks if you need to do that I hope that answers the

Jannick H: Okay, nice. Thanks.

Tyler Wright: Any other questions from anybody that's here? All right.  If not, then again, look out for announcements in Discord and other channels when next steps are ready as it pertains to again network upgrades for smart contracts as well as BME and associated test nets prior to that for the BME phase 2 incentivized test net.

Tyler Wright: Look out for announcements from myself or other members of the core team as we get closer and then if you're here here now or watching this call later, please share with other folks in the community to make sure they put BME through its paces prior to that network. Again, thank you Archer for the update on all the efforts across the core engineering team. if there's no other questions then you all can have some time back and again s community call later today and number of other s and working groups throughout the next couple of weeks. Happy 2026 everybody and again appreciate you Archer for the updates and everybody here. Have a great day y'all.

Rodri R: Happy new year to you too guys.

Artur Troian: Thanks everybody.  myself.

Rodri R: Thanks. See you around.

Tyler Wright: Thank you.

Tyler Wright: Bye-bye.

Benjamin B: Thank you.
