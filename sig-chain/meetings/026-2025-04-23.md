## Meeting Notes  

### Recap of the V038 Intermediate Upgrade  
- Tyler opened the session by noting that the last SIG Chain meeting coincided with the March 13th network upgrade.  
- Artur shared a recap of the V038 upgrade:  
  - Goal was to improve blockchain readability and migrate state for better performance.  
  - The upgrade was successful but took significantly longer than expected due to the size of the state and validator hardware performance.  
  - A secondary issue arose post-upgrade from block size congestion due to pruning settings.  
  - Validators were reminded that pruning should be turned off during upgrades to avoid similar issues, a known SDK limitation.  

### Progress Toward Cosmos SDK 47 Migration  
- Artur confirmed that SDK 47 migration work is gradually resuming.  
- Code changes are mostly complete, but the following items remain:  
  - Rebasing across multiple repositories to align with the latest upgrade.  
  - Retesting all migrations and preparing for a fresh testnet.  
  - Provider codebase work is on hold pending completion of JWT implementation.  
  - Work on documentation and developer examples is in progress and expected to conclude in the next few months.  

### JWT Authentication Implementation (AEP 64)  
- Artur explained that when the blockchain halts, MTLS prevents tenants from accessing workloads due to the inability to retrieve certificates from the chain.  
- MTLS also requires custom TS handshakes, complicating integration.  
- JWT implementation was proposed to resolve these issues:  
  - JWT allows workloads to authenticate even when the blockchain is down.  
  - Supports signing via authorized certificate authorities (e.g., Let's Encrypt), removing the need for custom MTLS.  
  - JWT and MTLS will co-exist temporarily before MTLS is deprecated.  
- Implementation of JWT began last week and is expected to be completed by the end of this week, followed by testing.  
- JWT does not require a chain upgrade, only changes to the provider and client logic.  

### Roadmap and Timeline  
- Artur shared that updated timelines for SDK 47 are reflected in AEP 30.  
- Estimated completion is August, accounting for:  
  - Team’s offsite event (Akash Accelerate) in late June  
  - Buffer time for integrations with partners like Hash  
  - The need for sandbox testing and validation  

### Community Involvement and Final Notes  
- Tyler invited community members to track milestones, commits, and specifications in the support repo and to get involved via Discord.  
- SIG Providers call and the end-of-month Steering Committee meeting were announced as follow-up sessions.  
- Tyler thanked Artur and the engineering team for their continued work and encouraged community members to stay engaged for SDK 47 testing.  

## Action Items  
- Artur Troian:  
  - Finalize JWT implementation and begin integration testing  
  - Resume rebasing and retesting SDK 47 migration repositories  
- Tyler Wright:  
  - Share updated AEP 64 and AEP 30 timelines with the community  
  - Coordinate opportunities for community involvement in SDK 47 testing  
- Community Members:  
  - Review AEP 64 for JWT specs and AEP 30 for SDK 47 roadmap  
  - Reach out on Discord to participate in testnet efforts


## **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: Good morning everybody. we'll get started in a minute or so. If you need to get anything, feel free to do so, but we'll get started in about a minute or so.

Artur Troian: Hello everyone.

Tyler Wright: I guess just for the sake of everyone's time and because we're already recording and transcribing, we can just get started.

Artur Troian: Okay, sounds good.

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG Chain monthly meeting. It is April 23rd, 2025. usually on a monthly basis during the SIG chain monthly meetings the group goes over everything related to the Akash blockchain anything related to network upgrades validator relations etc actually our last meeting was on March 13th during that meeting was the day of the last network upgrade I think we've talked during the steering committee and a number of other meetings about follow up from that network upgrade I know

Tyler Wright: that one of the big items that has been on hold and we've talked about this during steering committee and other meetings as well is the Cosmos SDK 47 migration. I think Archer will talk a little bit about some of the work that's being done in the interim especially coming out of that network upgrade around JWT and H64 and then following up with that I think the core team and those that'll be supporting the core team in some testing we'll get back to the Cosmos SDK47 migration. So, again, without further ado, I'll hand over to Archer to see if there's anything he wants to go into more detail around in terms of again the last network upgrade that happened March 13th,…

Tyler Wright: as well as anything else on the blockchain

Artur Troian: Thanks, T.

Artur Troian: Yeah, let's give a little bit of recap on what has happened and what's the status of the ZK47.  So the last upgrade was sort of intermediate to improve readability of the blockchain and the nature of that upgrade was that we need to migrate entire state and the upgrade sort of even we did a lot of simulations and tests in the real state in the real world it took way longer than was anticipated.

Artur Troian: So with all that, we're going to add a few extra steps while preparing for the network upgrades. and I'm going to be talking about it in a little bit. But in regards of the V038 that we had month and a half ago, I mean in overall the upgrade itself went quite well  So we didn't have any hiccups rather than it's just taking a lot of time and that's it.

Artur Troian: And the second item was that when the blockchain started making blocks, there was a bunch of transactions in the map pool that ended up in one block and that block was massive because every validator has the pruning setting on it held the chain.  So that's pretty much was second issue and frankly saying I completely forgot about that. we had a policy in the past that before upgrade the validators had to turn the pruning off because that was known issue. and it's still present in SDK. So there's nothing you can do about that rather than just turn it off before the upgrade starts and let it off for a few hours and then just reenable it.

Artur Troian: that obviously requires validators to be restarted but I think that's a minor inconvenience just to make sure that the chain restarts after the upgrade quickly. other than that I think once again it went other than just took a lot of time moving on into the long awaited 47. so we are slowly starting to resume work on that. upgrade itself pretty much completed I mean from the code perspective but there are a few items that needs to be addressed.


### 00:05:00

Artur Troian: So the very first item is we need to rebase entire code base on the latest network upgrade and it's not that much but once again there's a few branches a lot of repositories and it just takes time to rebase it all make sure that all of the migrations are complete retest everything and start the game test net so that's one item number two which is part of the SDK47

Artur Troian:  the chain SDK and we are slowly once again resuming work on that is the documentation and examples. So hopefully in the next few months we will be able to wrap this effort. The only item from the code perspective that is being on hold which rel to the SDK47 is the provider codebase. but we will be able to address it quite quickly as soon as we wrap up JWT implementation.

Artur Troian: So what this all about? when blockchain is down for let's say whatever reason maintenance there was an issue halt doesn't happen that often but it does as a last upgrade shown us tenants cannot access their workloads due to the MGLS implementation.  So pretty much whenever the blockchain is down the RPC node doesn't work and I mean it kind of works but most of them can be shut down and then what happens is you as a user trying to let's say get logs from the provider and doesn't work because the provider unable to pull certificate information from the blockchain. So that's one aspect of it.

Artur Troian: The second aspect the MTLS requires custom implementation for the TS pen shade which is okay but in modern world delays integration quite dramatically. So we've been having this JWT idea for a while just we were looking for the best possible solution and I think we finally found one. for all of the details regarding the JWT what it is in terms of Akash  network and how it's going to work you can refer to AP64 I think it has comprehensive description of the feature and the specification itself.

Artur Troian: So ultimately at the end what's going to happen is MTLS and JWT will leave alongside for some time and then later on most likely we will just deprecate J MTLS and then later on just cut it off completely because once again the GWT completely replaces it and it brings a lot of benefits like certificate signs by authorized CAS let's encrypt for example and that completely eliminates necessity of writing custom MGLS handshakes. So from the timeline perspective the JWT is been in work since last week.

Artur Troian: So, we plan to wrap up the implementation by end of this week and then we're going to just hand it for testing and integrations and pretty much switch to the SDK47 right away. the GWT doesn't need any upgrades. It's purely provider and client specific changes regarding the SDK.  So I just pushed update to the AP30 which is SDK47 upgrade with the estimated completion by August and the reason why is there are few things that happening right now. So first of all there is going to be a cash accelerate in end of June entire team will be offsite.

Artur Troian: So we want to have some cushion there as well as we have quite a few important integrations with the hash and we want them to test extremely well their implementations against the new code changes. So that means they need to test it against upgraded sandbox and that's going to take a little while and I kind of anticipate it need to be at least a month or so.  I think that is pretty much it for me Tyler about


### 00:10:00

Tyler Wright: Thank you, Does anyone have any questions for Archer about the last intermediate network upgrade or again the JWT implementation that's being worked on right now in AP64 andor next steps for Cosmos SDK47.  I know that the again core team is going to continue to track a number of these items via if you look at support there will be some milestones that will appear over the next few weeks in terms of mapping out some of the items. I know there's already one for the JWT 864 implementation that's happening right now.

Tyler Wright: So again, for those that want to learn more in between meetings or get more involved, again there's an easy way for folks to understand as Archer mentioned those things get updated timelines some of the issues that are related and folks can track commits. Just want to see if there's anything else as it pertains to the Akash blockchain that anybody wants to talk about here today.  If not, then again, Archer, much appreciate the update for the community on all things going on. For those that want to get more involved with the cost of the K47 migration, again though, I think there will be some opportunities for community testing.

Tyler Wright: So again, please reach out in Discord andor following this call to me, Tyler Core team if you want to get more involved during the testing phases for the cons47 migration. but look out for some more updates on the JWT work and the Archer and the core team are Hope everyone has a great rest of their day. Just a reminder, there's a sick providers call that'll be happening in a little bit over 45 minutes and then there will be the end of month steering committee call that'll be happening tomorrow. So, just a couple of things to look forward to, but appreciate everyone's time today. Again, thank you Archer for the updates and we'll see you next month.

Artur Troian: Just zero.

Tyler Wright: Bye-bye everyone.

Rodri R: You guys. Thanks.
