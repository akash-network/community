Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to Sig chain monthly. This has been a monthly meeting for some time. It is August 13th 2024 during the special interest group for the Akash blockchain. The group goes over anything related to cost blockchain or the core code as well as Anything related to network upgrades? We also talked about things related to cost us SDK in general. So anything from the Costco's ecosystem. I know there's some folks that have joined this call that a validators and other change. It might have experiences there that we can take into One of the big items that Sig chain has been tracking is been around the cosmos 47 Or problems sdk47 upgrade I will drop in.

Tyler Wright: The project there, but I'll hand it over to hartchurch just talk about anything related to Cosmos. That's the k47 upgrade or anything else that he wants to talk about Sig chain related. So Archer feel free to take it away.

Artur Troian: I'm sorry. Hello Alrighty, so the sdk47 which would be named topic of discussion for the last couple chains. Last week we have robbed up the code base migration so much actually, as well as not repo have migrated to the latest sdk47 question and all of the tests including unit tests and Joint last dollars migrations person Which is quite a good sign. So this moment stream is preparing testnet as well as test cases on how we going to run and you ate actual upgrade.

Artur Troian: we are running a little behind you to couple internal hydrology issues that means to be solved. So I think initially we planned to Personal this week, but we might actually be trying to next week, which is not quite a big deal.

Artur Troian: but anyways, we're gonna try this week to publish that's not the requirements that we would like To have and as well as there is a thought that we might ask holidays to vulnerabilitator. This is mainly predators to start a mods on the testnet as well just to simulate Lord as much as you can. wrapping that up I would say This is over there. How free today? Hopefully by the next time we meet here in the school. You should have more or less finalized date of when actual brings happen. questions

Tyler Wright: Thank you Archer and Artur not only update overclock Labs core engineering team will make them updates.

Tyler Wright: As comments on all the progress. I think there's been constant tracking of that inside the project that I just dropped in the chat. But in addition to that I as Artur mentioned there will be members of insiders the validated community and just a general community that will be participating in various test that's coming up soon. So there'll be announcements following up shortly on specific requirements. I'll be reaching out to individuals that have already showed interest in helping out and again can provide value and then we'll just provide again structure on how that will happen. So I know it's been a lot of work happening with the core team, many late nights long weekends so much appreciate all the work from Artur really led by Archer with support from the rest of the core engineering team. I know there's gonna be a lot of work that happens now on during the testing phase and make sure

Tyler Wright: ready for a network upgrade

Tyler Wright: Both does anyone have anything? Chain related that they want to discuss right now. Again, look out for announcements coming soon. There will be potentially an increase Cadence for some of these Community calls as we get closer to network upgrade again to produce such a big Network upgrade and so many things are being touched really the entire code base.

Tyler Wright: Excellent. Thank you Robert. And again, this is for rodri who just joined us. We're about to hop off.

There will be a number of announcements that are shared in Discord and Elsewhere for those that will be participating again. we will be looking for some validators to help spin up test that nodes to simulate again a better experience for testing. So a project I know you're a validator but we'll make sure to again get all the appropriate people involved during those steps make announcements anybody here that sees anybody in Discord or elsewhere that is Technical and has been involved what's again involved in testing process, please Point them alive direction or reports the sick chain, and we can follow up there.

Tyler Wright: But again much appreciate all the effort from Archer Scott and the rest of the core engineering team. There'll be some more announcements coming soon as we get closer to again publishing information and starting the testnet. So look out for information over the next couple of days into next week, but appreciate everyone's time here today. Enjoy the rest of your day, and we'll follow up very soon. Thank you again. Bye.
