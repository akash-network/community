## Notes

- Artur talked about the [network upgrade v0.24.0](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/73).
- It is the goal for Akash to test the upgrade with the dataset. Osmosis team has done this.
- Now have the ability to test network upgrades on datasets with snapshot. 
- Tests for v0.24.0 went well. Tested a couple of times. The tests will be running in github actions.
- The upgrade tests will be running continuously until the new network upgrade node is reached. 
- Andrey has already set up an environment to export genisus snapshot. Going to zip and store somewhere. This will shorten download time.
- The network upgrade tests should take 20 minutes. This will give huge confidence in testing.
- Network Upgrade is very close. Dates will be released soon.
- Upgrade will include migration of CRD and manifest for Provider upgrade. Artur said that the upgrade will automatically migrate these items. 
- Next Upgrade will include migration to Cosmos 46x. This is when we will have to start tracking for versions. Most of cosmos ecosystem is on 46x or 47x.
- Tyler asked the group if there were any items worth sharing as other chains upgrade on Cosmos. There was nothing of note, but all are welcome to share any findings in the [sig-chain discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/747885925232672829/1062751164065665114/1072576663784792124).
