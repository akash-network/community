## Notes

- Artur talked about the [network upgrade v0.24.0](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/73).
- [Issue #83](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/83) will be solved in the next network upgrade v0.24.0.
- Artur talked to Osmosis about how they test upgrades. Akash will take a snapshot of the mainnet.
- Artur is working on scripts for testing environments. Artur is working to find the best option to do this. 
- The dataset is very big, so it needs to be tested a few different ways. 
- There will be some internal testnets done first, as it has been done in the past. 
- There will be an API change. Once the API is finalized, folks will be alerted.
- Exchange partners and clients will have to make updates to their nodes. 
- Instructions will need to be made and tested for Provider upgrade and Network Upgrade. 
- Tyler asked the group if there were any items worth sharing as other chains upgrade on Cosmos. There was nothing of note, but all are welcome to share any findings in the [sig-chain discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/747885925232672829/1062751164065665114/1072576663784792124)
