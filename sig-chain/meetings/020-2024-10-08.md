## Meeting Notes

### Akash Network Updates
- Tyler Wright opened the meeting, discussing the role of SIG Chain meetings in addressing Akash Network blockchain topics, particularly validator relations, network upgrades, and overall health.
- Highlighted recent async discussions in lieu of last week’s meeting to accommodate the heavy workload of the Overclock Labs Core Team.

### Cosmos SDK 47 Network Upgrade
- Tyler shared that the focus of recent efforts has been the Cosmos SDK 47 upgrade, a significant project led by Artur and the engineering team.
- Artur provided a comprehensive update on the SDK 47 upgrade:
  - **Testing Approach:** Localized testing using snapshots from the mainnet for migration validation.
  - **Challenges:** High memory requirements, with upgrade processes needing over 384GB of RAM to run reliably. This memory demand has presented logistical issues in setting up sufficient test environments.
  - **Progress:** Artur shared confidence that testing could yield reproducible results soon, with hopes to proceed by week’s end.
- Artur also noted that this upgrade process has unblocked other network functionalities like basic blockchain interactions, state synchronization, and deployment creation.

### Validator Expansion and Token Distribution
- Dominikus raised questions on validator expansion, referring to Akash’s Tokenomics document that suggests gradual increases in validator numbers.
- Artur responded that further validator increases could strain network performance due to latency issues, especially during periods of high transaction volume.
  - Emphasized the need for decentralizing token distribution among validators, though the current validator cap is considered sufficient.
  - Highlighted that anyone can create a validator, but they must secure adequate delegations to enter the active set.
- Tyler added that foundation delegations now require higher standards, including infrastructure robustness and technical capability.
  - Noted that as the network matures, foundation delegations are increasingly awarded to participants showing sustained, meaningful contributions to the Akash ecosystem.

### Community Involvement and Next Steps
- Tyler discussed the ongoing community testing initiatives, encouraging volunteers to assist with SDK 47 upgrade testing.
  - Mentioned that additional channels or Discord updates would provide information for interested community testers.
  - Urged community members to reach out if interested in joining the testing efforts and to stay active on SIG Chain’s Discord channel for updates.
- Tyler concluded the meeting by reiterating the importance of community engagement in validator roles and thanked participants for their time and contributions.

## Action Items
- **Artur Troian:** Complete initial reproducible testing for the SDK 47 upgrade by the end of the week.
- **Scott Carruthers:** Continue developing the testing plan for network upgrades and coordinate with volunteer testers.
- **Tyler Wright:** Maintain updates on testing progress and share announcements on the SIG Chain Discord channel.
- **Community Members:** Reach out via SIG Chain Discord to join testing efforts for the network upgrade.
