## Notes

- Artur talked about the binary update today.
- Previously there were limitations on the Network. When we added GPUs
- This fix is non consensus breaking, but it is configuration breaking. Binary update is planned for an hour or so.
- Deval asked if providers are going to be updated as well. Artur says providers can use the older version, but they cannot bid on workloads.
- Artur talked about the impending network upgrade. Artur talked about this issue.
- Mainnet 8 will introduce resource offer into the bid. The idea is that in the future, provider will be able to offer different configurations.
- Governance Proposal and block height will be coming soon.
- Artur talked about a draft of implementation for Packet forwarding. That is the upgrade after Mainnet 8. This will either happen in December 2023 or January 2024.
- CosmosSDK 0.50 has been released this week. Akash is on 0.45x. Core teams plans to wait for some time to see other changes moving. No plans to move over the next 6 months.
- Deval needs help with CRD, as they work on provider services code changes for Content moderation.
- Deval will update the project issue in Github with specific questions.
- Artur would like all code base questions or ideas to go in Github, where he and others can comment in 1 specific place. Feel free to tag Artur on github for comment.
