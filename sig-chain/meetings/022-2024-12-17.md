- Tyler reminded validators about updated infrastructure requirements for the upgrade:
  - Minimum requirements: 128GB RAM and 8-core CPU.
  - Validators were notified in September, and reminders will continue through Q1 2025.
- Mentioned community engagement opportunities in Testnet 6 and encouraged participation via Discord.

### Future Meetings and Schedule Adjustments
- Tyler noted the possibility of changes to SIG Providers and SIG Support meetings due to holiday schedules.

## Transcript

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG Chain monthly meeting. This is December 17th, 2024. This will be the last special interest group for the chain of 2024. During this monthly meeting, the group here at SIG Chain goes through all things related to the Akash blockchain. that includes network upgrades that includes validator relations all again kind of blockchain related items. We have a repo and we have another SIG where we talk about issues inside of core repos whether it be the net or provider or other repos and we talk about specific issues.

Tyler Wright: those issues get triaged. But again, this specific SIG we oftentimes have more often when there's a happening. but we keep this monthly cadence talk about all things related to blockchain validator network upgrades. her who is a lead engineer and does a lot of the heavy lifting oftentimes comes to this SIG chain just to give some updates. Scott who is currently out of office this week is also active in this SIG. couple of things to note before I hand over to Archer. Again, one of the bigger efforts that the SIG chain is monitoring that we talk about on a monthly basis is the migration from Cosmos SDK 45 to 47. This is an effort that the core engineering team has been leading for some time.

Tyler Wright: there was a proposal that went on chain passed. the goal is to have this network upgrade very early in 2025. The original plan was the end of 2024, but as we've talked about in past meetings, it's just such a big massive upgrade and there's a lot of testing that has to get done by various folks. over the last couple of weeks slashmonth we've had a test net 5 which has been phase one of the Cosmos SDK 45 to 47 testing. There's been testing of basic functionality of modules on the deployment side. we've gotten support from members of the community. So thank you for folks in the community that have been helping out with testing some of that functionality.

Tyler Wright: now we've been moving into phase two which will include again provider upgrades as well as the ability for clients and other folks that are integrating with the clash API and elsewhere to be able to test their integrations in an environment that has Cosmos SDK 47. so again, we're continuing to move forward in our plan towards what we hope is a seamless upgrade we've had so many in the past. I know Archer has been working hard on a number of different elements. So, I'm going to hand it over to Archer to just quickly give an update on all the things that he's been working on related to COM SDK 45 to 47 migration.

Artur Troian: Thanks, all right, I'll just quickly share my screen for one of the items I just like to sort of tell about and this upgrade is absolutely massive and it just touches couple important items and to remind everyone it's not only the blockchain but the centralized cloud as well. So we have to be sort of really careful on what we do, how we execute the upgrade and so on so forth. so you all can track the progress of sort of API update and the state of it within the arach API repository. our we have done a gradual of effort to separate the code base and make sort of SDK experience for everybody as easy as possible and that transition pretty much will be wrapped up with the finish of the SDK 47.

Artur Troian: So this branch has pretty much all of the new directory ructure package structure that will be available with this upgrade. pretty much the golden parts and all the protobuffs have been done. We just waiting from my team here to finish up the TypeScript and AkashJS migration.  It's going to take a little bit of time before we do a code freeze here and move on with the more widespread testing for the decentralized cloud that's the providers and the deployments. So we are now having the testnet number two it's technically number six test net six but this is the second test net with the SDK47.

Artur Troian: the goal of this testnet will be to test the clients. we have done great deal of testing in the test net phase one over the CLI just to check all the transactions make sure that all the query queries works and all the passing blockchain operations can be performed flawlessly. There was a couple minor issues but pretty much everything went quite smooth.  So as soon as the TypeScript client is up to date and our Akash console is picking it up for the testnet, we're going to extend the testing for everybody to icip upgrade their clients. I think Luna, you're going to be interested in that quite heavily. this test does not f

Artur Troian: Right now there are different teams using the both Golang and Typescript API. So before we proceed to the network upgrade we have to test the whole thing as quickly as we can. that's pretty much the wrap up of that regarding the timeline.  So we plan to do it sometime in the considering we are already entering the holiday season there a little bit of quietness in next couple weeks but we hope that by end of this year we will have at least RC version of the TypeScript implementation.

Artur Troian: So we will enter new year with the full AFPK and opportunity to test it right after the holidays. there's a little bit of lack of documentation related to the Aashpk and we also going to solve this sometime after new year and hopefully to provide as easy documentation as possible from developer perspective. I think that covers it. Any questions? All righty. then tell her about

Artur Troian: 

Tyler Wright: Excellent. Thank you very much,…

Tyler Wright: Again, I've dropped in the specific poll that Archer referenced during this call. Poll 174 inside the Kosh API repo. So, just for people's reference, anybody over the next couple of weeks that again, announcements will be made in Discord and elsewhere once we want to bring in more folks for additional testing. If anybody misses any of those announcements or wants to get access, please feel free to reach out to myself or Scott Kurthers over the next couple of weeks. and again we'll make sure that folks have necessary access to that test net 6 environment.

Tyler Wright: The only other thing that I'll mention especially as we continue to get closer to the network upgrade is and I've dropped this message in Discord some time ago, but just a reminder to all validators, there is going to be a new minimum requirements for 128 gigs of RAM and 8 core CPU will be minimum for this network upgrade just because again it is such a big massive upgrade. I know historically we've had some folks that have had not had that type of infrastructure and it's just been slower during network upgrades of just getting them to produce blocks. So for the ease of this massive upgrade again we've updated those minimum requirements.

Tyler Wright: That's something that was made that the community and the validators were made aware of in September. So again, I'm going to continue to follow up with people to make sure that those minimum requirements are met as we head into this next network upgrade in Q1 2025.  Any other questions or any other topics anybody wants to talk about as it pertains to the Akash blockchain network upgrades, validator relations, etc. Cool. If not, then again, feel free to use the SIG chain, Discord channel, or any of the other Discord channels, as it pertains to anything you may need.

Tyler Wright: Again, I believe there will be a sig providers meeting later this week. We'll talk about some items I may move the six support meeting later in the month or early January just because of folks availability. but again look out for any schedule changes. Thank you for your participation here today and again look out for announcements in Discord and other channels as TestNet 6 gets opened up to more folks. and as we get closer to this next network upgrade. Much appreciated everyone's time today. again, look out for announcements and we'll certainly continue to talk online. Thank you, Artur, for the update. Appreciate you all.
