## Meeting Notes
#### Tyler Wright: 
- Tyler Wright welcomed everyone to the meeting.
- The working group emerged from Sig providers, focusing on tracking the p-i-3's work on building an open-source automated auditor on the network.
- A proposal was put up on-chain at the end of 2023, which passed.
- Tyler shared the proposal in the chat.
- The group aims to monitor the p-i-3's work and address any questions or concerns.
- Dedicated sessions will be held for discussing project-related matters.
- Cloudmos team's contributions were acknowledged.
- Currently, the auditing process is managed by Andre, with a template available in the community repo.
- The working group intends to improve the auditing process over time.
- The focus of the inaugural meeting is to check in with the p-i-3 team and establish meeting cadence and timelines.
- Benjamin was handed over to provide updates on the p-i-3's progress and next steps.

### Benjamin Update (p-i-3 team)
- Learning GoLang for contributions, along with Sebastian.
- Planning to structure the project by creating prototypes first, then integrating into Cloudmos.
- Conducted small testing for benchmarking system capabilities.
- Challenges with accessing working temperature data.
- Seeking options for outsourcing KYC updates and verifying companies' information globally.
- Requesting ideas or connections for improving verification methods.
#### Questions for Discussion:
- Are there better options available for outsourcing KYC updates?
- Ideas on how to verify companies' information globally?
- Suggestions for improving verification methods?
- Open floor for discussion and suggestions regarding the questions raised by Benjamin.
### Anil's Updates
- Anil Murty suggests expanding benchmarking tests to include parameters available through Nvidia SMI command, such as fan speed and temperature.
- Anil Murty mentions previous use of KYC services by the labs team, potentially offering options or recommendations for other providers.
- Benjamin  expresses interest in KYC solutions with minimal involvement of third parties.
- Maxime Beauchamp discusses benchmarking methods involving specific workloads or Docker containers on providers, potentially integrating benchmarking into the provider service.
- Benjamin and Maxime discuss the feasibility and benefits of integrating benchmarking into the provider service natively.
- Benjamin acknowledges the potential cost-saving benefits of utilizing the discovery service for benchmarking.
### Scott's Updates
- Scott Carruthers discussed the upcoming release of a functionality called feature Discovery within Provider Services.
- Feature Discovery is accessible via grpc and provides visibility into individual providers and across the network.
- Full GPU Discovery is a key aspect, offering information on GPU types, allocation, and availability.
- Worker nodes with multiple GPU models will provide detailed information on allocated GPUs.
- The functionality will enable analysis across the network, indicating total GPUs and allocation status.
- Rollout to strategic providers like Shimpa and Rodrigo is underway.
- Benjamin B acknowledged the inclusion of CPU information and potential for future additions based on demand.
- Information is accessible via direct grpc queries or the Cloudmos API, with a provided grpc query link for exploration.
- Participants are encouraged to explore the provided link for firsthand experience with the feature.
### Potential falsification of resource information by providers. 
- Luna raised concerns about ensuring providers do not falsely advertise their resources.
- Scott Carruthers emphasized that feature Discovery aims to address this issue by providing constant, real-time updates on resources through a grpc stream.
- Feature Discovery operates at a PCI bus level, not relying on third-party binaries.
- Luna inquired about potential vulnerabilities at lower levels beyond the PCI interface.
- Scott Carruthers acknowledged the possibility but stated that, currently, there are no known limitations or concerns regarding feature Discovery's effectiveness.
- Benjamin B suggested that, despite safeguards, there may still be ways to falsify information, but addressing such issues would require time, incentives, and further exploration.  

### More Questions (Benjamin Update p-i-3 team )
- Benjamin B raised a question regarding the accessibility of global databases for certain countries, noting potential challenges in obtaining data.
- Alani Kuye inquired about the process for provider checks, audits, and incentives, particularly regarding participation in incentive programs and the audit process.
- Tyler Wright redirected the discussion, suggesting that questions regarding provider incentives and audits should be addressed at the Sig providers level.
- Tyler clarified that a specific working group is primarily focused on developing automated auditing tools, while manual audits are conducted as part of the provider incentive pilot program.
- Further discussion on provider incentives and audits is scheduled for the Sig providers meeting next week.

### Functionality and usage of the "provider TX audit attributes" command.
- Benjamin B resumed the presentation, mentioning the possibility of reading data via API instead of relying heavily on CLI commands.
- Benjamin posed a question regarding the ease of using the "provider TX audit attributes" command and sought clarification on its functionality.
- Andrey Arapov explained the process of broadcasting transactions on the blockchain to sign attributes and monitor changes, emphasizing the importance of ensuring attributes are signed.
- Andrey  clarified that while it's theoretically possible to broadcast specific attribute changes, the tool typically broadcasts all signed attributes.
- Benjamin  discussed potential future uses of multiple wallets for signing purposes and expressed gratitude for Andrey's insights.
- Andrey  offered to provide further information and requested to be pinged on Discord for assistance.

### Project Deliverables and Timeline 
- Benjamin B expressed gratitude for the shared link and concluded the presentation, addressing any remaining questions.
- Tyler Wright raised the topic of project deliverables and suggested establishing a cadence for progress updates and testing phases.
- Tyler proposed a monthly cadence for the first three months, transitioning to a weekly cadence thereafter to meet the proposed timeline.
- Benjamin  agreed with the proposed timeline, noting that most tasks will likely be completed simultaneously rather than staggered.
- Sebastian confirmed agreement with the proposed meeting schedule and timing.
- The team agreed to continue monthly meetings, with potential transition to weekly meetings in the future. Meetings will continue on Wednesdays at 7 pm.

### Final words
- Tyler Wright proposed creating a plan for the first deliverable to be discussed in the next meeting, along with a short testing plan, to ensure tracking of progress for those unable to attend meetings.
- Benjamin B expressed a preference for online discussions over using images for benchmarking, inviting input from team members on alternative approaches.
- Benjamin B thanked participants for their contributions and assistance in answering questions throughout the meeting.
- Tyler Wright confirmed plans to create a specific repository for the working group on provider audits, containing meeting notes and relevant documentation.
- Tyler extended gratitude to all participants and encouraged continued involvement in the Discord community.
