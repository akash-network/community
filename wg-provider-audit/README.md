## Goals

- Pi3 is looking to contribute to the Cloudmos indexer to expand their tasks to include examples such as: benchmarking, testing RPC nodes, tracking the lease uptime of providers, and other trackable metrics to include in their API. We would also want snapshots of this database to be made semi-regularly, if there is demand for this.

- Pi3 Team is looking to create our own open source services:
  - Stat-based, tier-based auditing service, where filtering API can be used on Cloudmos & signing can happen for CLI users. Example on the filtering this would allow.
  - General auditing, where we can have a general audit similar to how Overclock Labs sign their providers, and how Moultrie Audits signed providers. We create a set of criteria that we think are "good enough," and sign generally from this.
  - KYC-based auditing on providers and tenants. Details for this are TBD and to do the KYC, we would be working with companies that do this as a service.
  - Yet another Akash Stats Page, if there is demand for one. In the past weeks, some questions have not been able to be responded to due to data not being formatted in such a way.
  - To our knowledge, this relates to: rich lists as a pie graph, the community pool growth over time, and provider filtering shown as a demo here.
