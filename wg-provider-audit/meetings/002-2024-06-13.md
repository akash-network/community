## Meeting Notes

**Introduction:**
- Tyler Wright welcomed everyone and provided background on the group’s formation.
- Noted issues with previous meeting timings and the availability of meeting notes and transcripts post-meeting.



**Demo of Benchmarking Tool:**
- Benjamin B provided an update and introduced the upcoming demo by Sebastian (rUqeRT).
- The benchmarking tool consists of four main parts:
  1. Indexer - Deploys to various providers.
  2. Benchmark - Runs the actual benchmarks.
  3. Database - Stores the data (using PostgreSQL).
  4. API - Gathers data from the database.
- Demo showcased the deployment process, running benchmarks, storing results, and accessing data via API.
- Example API call to fetch benchmark data for providers was demonstrated.

**High-Level Overview of Provider Auditing:**
- **Scott Carruthers:** Requested an overview of the provider auditing process and its integration with Cloudmos.
- **rUqeRT:** Explained the use of API for accessing benchmark data and potential for expansion.
- **Benjamin B:** Discussed plans to integrate benchmark results directly on the blockchain and signing benchmarks on-chain.

**Q&A Session:**
- **Anil Murty:** Asked about the benchmark comparison to a Raspberry Pi and its swappability.
  - **rUqeRT:** Confirmed it's possible to swap out the baseline comparison and provided rationale for using Raspberry Pi as a familiar baseline.
- **Deval Patel:** Inquired about the frequency of running benchmarks, handling hardware changes, and displaying benchmark results on provider status pages.
  - **Benjamin B:** Confirmed the capability to run benchmarks more frequently and discussed the potential for additional attributes.
- **Tyler Wright:** Clarified the goal of open-sourcing the auditing tools.
  - **Benjamin B:** Affirmed the plan to open source the tools and allow others to run them independently.
- **Deval Patel:** Suggested integrating the benchmarking tool as an optional part of core platform engineering for continuous data capture.
  - **Benjamin B:** Supported the idea for smaller benchmarks and uptime checks but highlighted challenges with more complex benchmarks like GPUs.

**Next Steps and Planning:**
- **Benjamin B:** Acknowledged the need for partnerships between auditors and providers for cost-effective benchmarking.
- **KYC Integration:**
  - Addressed the withdrawal of the KYC idea in favor of a decentralized trust system inspired by a hackathon submission.
  - Suggested multiple trusted entities could sign off on KYC, improving the trust system.
  - Discussed implementation strategies and the need for feedback from Scott regarding the best way to enable address-to-address trust sign-offs.
- **Console Integration:**
  - Mentioned the plan to either send back funds to the community pool or extend the deadline for integration.
  - Clarified the goal of integrating benchmarking results into Cloudmos and console for filtering and selection based on verified attributes and KYC status.
- **Uptime Indicator Clarification:**
  - Benjamin B clarified the current uptime indicator in the provider dashboards is based on the provider's ability to interact with the service rather than lease uptime.
- **Future Directions:**
  - Anil Murty suggested building a service that runs periodically to increase the number of variables available for users to select providers, considering both price and uptime history.
- **Next Session Planning:**
  - **Tyler Wright:** Asked about the timeline for the next demo and narrowing down the direction moving forward.
  - **Benjamin B:** Estimated a timeline of 14 to 20 days for the next demo.
  - **Tyler Wright:** Agreed to follow up offline to finalize the schedule for the next session.

**Closing Remarks:**
- Tyler Wright encouraged everyone to continue discussions in the working group for provider audit channel or the specific project tile.
- Benjamin B requested notes and transcript to be sent privately as an additional reference.
- Tyler Wright agreed to share the notes later in the day.

## Action Items
- **Benjamin B:** Share [links](https://github.com/luxas/benchmark) to the actual benchmark being used in the WG provider channel on Discord.
- **Tyler Wright:** Ensure meeting notes and transcript are posted in the repo for this working group and shared privately with Benjamin B.
- **rUqeRT:** Explore and document how to swap benchmark baselines for future flexibility.
- **All Members:** Review the shared benchmark links and provide feedback or suggestions on potential improvements or additional benchmarks to consider.
- **Benjamin B and Deval Patel:** Discuss the integration of benchmarking tools into the core platform engineering for continuous data capture and notification.
