# Akash Network Projects

These are all the projects that are currently in some state ranging from "ideation" to "release". To understand the various states see the table at the bottom of this page.

**General guidelines for updating this table**

- Projects that are in some working state (ideation or beyond) should have a link to their specific sig or wg page (can even just be a github issue inside the repo for the sig) from the "Project Name"
- Projects that are in a working state should have a label specified here and linked to a filtered list of github issues for that label
- Projects that are in a working state should be assigned to a SIG or WG
- Projects that are not even in ideation (not in a working state) should have a name and a brief description

## Project States

A project may be in one of these states. Note that every project does NOT have to touch every one of these states and some projects may remain in a given state for a long time (like an idea that never gets any interest from the community to implement and remains in "ideation" for a long time).

| State | Description | Things needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ideation | A rough idea for a project has been proposed |
| spec-definition | Specification (typically a PRD or a ligher version of it in a github issue) is being worked on by a SIG or WIG and is in review |
| spec-approved | The specification for the project has been approved and it has been allocated to specific SIG(s) | |
| design | Technical Design is being worked on (typically by SIG(s) )
| implementation | Actual work to bring the thing to life is happening (code being written, event being organized, docs site being updated) | |
| beta | The project is in beta test phase (where/ when applicable) - typically for products/ features | |
| release | The product/ feature has been released to everyone (general availability) | |
| blocked | The project is blocked or stalled because of some reason (documented) | |
| abandoned | The project has been cancelled because no one is willing to shepherd it | |
