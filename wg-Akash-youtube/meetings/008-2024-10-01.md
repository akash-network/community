## Meeting Notes

- **Steering Committee Video Update**:
  - Robert presented the latest updates on the steering committee videos. A total of 19 steering committee videos have been edited, including trimming dead air at the beginning and end and adding an intro/outro animation.
  - Periodic call-to-action reminders appear every five minutes to encourage subscriptions and interactions. These include reminders about following Akash on social media.
  - Robert is awaiting Tyler’s approval to make these videos public. They are currently unlisted, viewable only via shared links.

- **Akash Console and Praetor Video Plans**:
  - Robert discussed creating a series of videos for Akash’s primary tools, Akash Console and Praetor, noting that a single, comprehensive video might be challenging to keep updated.
  - B S suggested breaking down the content into smaller segments, making it easier to update individual videos if features change.
  - Robert will prepare initial drafts covering the Akash Console’s deployment features, templates, and setup procedures. He also plans to confirm if any significant updates are forthcoming for either tool to avoid creating outdated content.

- **Funding Video for Wallet Setup**:
  - There was a discussion about including a separate video to guide users on funding their Akash wallet, specifically for new users who may face difficulties during deployments due to insufficient funds.
  - Robert agreed to add this video to the YouTube backlog. B S recommended including common exchanges like Coinbase in this video for a smoother onboarding process.

- **YouTube Partner Program and Revenue Goals**:
  - Robert shared the requirements for Akash’s eligibility in the YouTube Partner Program, including subscriber count, video upload frequency, watch hours, and shorts views.
  - The Akash YouTube channel currently meets the subscriber threshold (over 3,600) but needs more recent uploads and higher engagement with shorts to qualify.
  - There was excitement about potential revenue, which could support both the Akash community pool and content creators directly, depending on future budget allocations.

- **Backlog and Content Planning**:
  - Robert emphasized the importance of the YouTube backlog document to track content ideas and prioritize tasks. It will include ideas such as wallet funding, tutorial series for Akash Console, and other educational videos.
  - B S shared the backlog link in the chat, enabling participants to add or review future content ideas.

- **Featured Videos Playlist Update**:
  - Robert added new external videos to the Featured Videos playlist, including a recent presentation by Akash’s Greg at Token 2049.
  - This playlist aims to spotlight Akash-related videos hosted on other channels that garner significant viewership, further promoting Akash Network’s content.

## Action Items
- **Robert Del Rey**:
  - Follow up with Tyler regarding making steering committee videos public.
  - Begin drafting segmented video content for Akash Console and Praetor, confirming any upcoming updates to these tools.
  - Add a separate video idea on funding Akash wallets to the backlog, covering major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken.
  - Continue engaging with YouTube comments and actively promote Akash on both YouTube and Omniflix TV.

- **B S**:

# **Transcript**

Robert Del Rey: And Hello everybody and welcome to today's a YouTube working Group call. This is a weekly And we chat about all A cash YouTube, the focus at the moment, it's improving the content quality.

Robert Del Rey: In revamping the channel, Improve playlists, add new videos. Like I said, all things related to a cash YouTube My name is Del Rey. And today is October 1st. 2024. Many members of the Akash team are troubling. So it's possible that this call has low attendance, but we are recording it for people. Later.

Robert Del Rey: All right, all right, so let's jump right into it. I will share my screen.

Robert Del Rey: I was very excited for today's call. He proposed We've been working In the Cash Sitting Committee videos.

Robert Del Rey: when I say B s I Denny's and all the people writing sleep to these videos So they are nineteen videos at the moment. About the steering community Maybe we can watch one now so you can notice the drill.

Robert Del Rey: The steering community call. We had last week. I haven't got the recording of that one, but as soon as I get it, I will definitely update that to YouTube.

Robert Del Rey: That's available. So yeah, some things To notice here. Aside from the beginning, the thumbnail I already speak up spoken about this. You might not see it because of the time here but there is a forward symbol accelerate, you can see it here. I guess it's going very big and it's been accelerate, so let's do that. Let's accelerate Anyway, here you have a brief description about what we spoke about in For example, a steering community. Call number 12, cover key updates on the developer onboarding program. I guess, about that one. Education initiatives, I can see you.

Robert Del Rey: Provider building programs discussion about Amy Finest. Dlx for marketing. And Lots of stuff. I mean, this cold mostly cover, the silly initiative, just so, you can see here in the title, we have developer onboarding and provider strategies Steering Community. Call Number 12. A cash network.

Robert Del Rey: There is a call to action. In all videos descriptions, you will find a call to action. It's going to be different depending on the video, just to give some priority to that. and All the links leading to a cash network. Are here and more about For those of you that don't know. YouTube automatically adds videos related to In the lower part of the description. and you just have to add more about the cash and they add those videos below or you can manually just add Any link to any video that you want to see there at the moment, I'm just leaving it automatically. Same as the timestamps. So let's open up the video, right.

Robert Del Rey: So, you can see later, what is it about? You're gonna notice the intro,

Robert Del Rey: So there have We have a quick Intro animation, things b, s and then it's for the ideas. at the end, I believe it came out really good and it jumps right into Tyler or the Speaker of the call, someone calls, it's Tyler, some calls, we have Adam, some calls, we have Anil, it doesn't matter. What I do is I try to edit the videos to make sure they start. When they call it starts, sometimes, the recording starts but they mentioned things.


### 00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: That maybe are not related to the steering community call or just an extra topic or maybe it's just that air waiting for more people joining. I edit those out of the video. So it jumps right into Tyler giving the introduction. Same happens At the end I noticed that

Robert Del Rey: I noticed that in the end, some people stay in the call. For example, this call was 44 minutes but the original file. It's one hour. When it reached to an hour, if there is no one talking they call ends automatically. So, usually I get 10 to 15 minutes of that air, because someone remain in the call silent. So, I removed that From the end and add the cash intro in the end. So here's how it looks.

Robert Del Rey: And you see it ends animation again and that's it. So yeah, Really nice. Just to make sure there is no bit. Hey, look, who's talking there. So that was just to make sure there was not that air in the video. You can find me here. Many people are spoken in this call. It's a good One thing I wanted you to see and this is the last thing we added to those videos, is that every five minutes, you're gonna see this in the lower side of the screen.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, can you see it here? You see here?

Robert Del Rey: Use the notifications. I guess it's a good reminder for people. It's a good call to action and also that helps them starting paying attention to the video again, sometimes you get distracted and then something happens. And then you pay attention to the video. I guess this can cause this effect. the other message, it's gonna be about Twitter. this, It opens up. It remains in the screen for three to four seconds and then it goes down.

Robert Del Rey: We maybe try to play around in different sites of the screen. I'm thoroughly open for suggestions. But we can bring them in other videos. Sadly with YouTube.

Robert Del Rey: If we want to upload something, the video has to be ready. We cannot edit the video after is upload it. So we got to make sure everything is ready before hitting the upload. But right.

Robert Del Rey: So that's all I have for the Steering Committee videos update. I will catch a quick breath. In the meantime, you can bring your questions or comments if any

Robert Del Rey: If not that's totally fine guys. Remember, you can take your questions Into a cash discord. We have a YouTube channel there dedicated for that so feel free to drop your questions and comments. Yeah, that's all I have for the student community videos, suddenly Tyler's done on this call. I will need to send him a message.

Robert Del Rey: When, do they want to go live at the moment? They are unlisted, meaning that nobody can see them. Unless I shared this link with you. But nobody can see them. So, I need to follow up with Tyler to see Can we make these public? Hopefully, when they are public, we can get lots of support from their cash community. Remember guys, to subscribe to their cash YouTube channel. If you haven't and comments in all our videos because it helps getting in front of more people. So yeah, let me quickly go to the chat. I saw a message, We work on the videos. I like the periodic call to actions. Thanks, B! S, You demand, thank you for the designs ideas. Also, hopefully we can make more videos in the future.


### 00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: But yeah, I thought those periodic reminders would be a good idea. Because sometimes it happens to me that I start watching a video from the feed. In maybe that channel appears so often on the feed. That I think that I'm subscribed to that channel. But actually, I'm not. And when they say the code to action, remember to and subscribe, usually that gives me a break to think about it. And most of the time, I noticed that I'm not subscribed and I subscribe. So, hopefully, this can cause the same effect in the people watching.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah and also when we make these videos come from the recording but we have in plan doing other kinds of videos. So I guess it's gonna be important to have those call to actions in all kinds of videos in a cash YouTube. But yeah, again, 19 the steering committee videos. This is everything since Akash went open source. So yeah, that's what I have. So, let's see when we upload a steering community called video. number 20, and when we make public the rest,

Robert Del Rey: Let me write that down, so yeah. Anything else you guys want to talk about the sitting committee videos? Otherwise, I move on to the next topic of the agenda.

Robert Del Rey: All right, the infinite circle. All right, so if nothing I'll move on then.

Robert Del Rey: Mmm.

Robert Del Rey: All the next topic in here, again, it's about a cash console videos and Prater videos. I would like to get more details about him, let me stop sharing the scroll.

Robert Del Rey: So I crash console and paid for as I guess those are the biggest tools available in a cash community. Initially, they started as individual projects and then Overclock team in the community decided to acquire them both, which is awesome. It shows you actually how far you can get in a cash if you actually make it happen, right? So yeah, I got console, It's a tool. For deployments. Yeah, that was the word and Prater. Mostly helps setting up providers. It's a fun interface to create providers. So since they are the two biggest tools we have available besides a cash shot, which is a fairly new.

Robert Del Rey: I thought it was important to have videos. In fact, it was Tyler who mentioned that we should have and a cash console video. So I wanted to discuss some of the details That. maybe we can agree on and have them in the video. So the next two weeks, I'm planning on working on that video so I can have it ready for the next call. So, I believe it's important to have those details sorted out before I started working in a video. So yeah, starting from the beginning.

Robert Del Rey: There has to be an Intro to console, Letting people know what is it about and what people can do with it.

Robert Del Rey: I don't know and please forgive me, but I don't know if there are gonna be changes or updates happening into console. It is very important to confirm that. Because imagine if we do a video about console and in the next week, they update console Now, we will need to do a new video, so I guess it's very important to confirm. Also, if there are updates happening soon,


### 00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: I guess I wanted to speak to with Tyler about this, right? So, enter the console and confirm upcoming changes.

Robert Del Rey: Or maybe I'm confused. I don't know if the one But what was about to change was console or crater. I know they're updating them constantly. But yeah, we need to confirm that. a very basic video, how I see it is that we can have Covering the basic stuff like an intro to Console console always is gonna help you with deployments on a cash network, we can go over the templates in console. If you have a notice on the left side, you got different paths. One of those tabs is templates and you can take any of those templates and

Robert Del Rey: And copy them and deploy, whatever the template has on a cache using Console. You can even have one, click Deployments and stuff, so I guess that's important to have in that video as well.

Robert Del Rey: And I don't know what must be in the video. Let's see what B s has to say about it. Breaking into several smaller videos. Will be better. So that they can more easily be updated as needed. Yeah. Yeah. I like that. Yeah. Because for example, let's say, If we upload, at three series video, one is an intro one. It's how to deploy and the third one. It's about whatever, having a cash on Twitter, It's just a crazy example, If they update the process of Coping a template and doing a deployment. it's going to be easier for us just to

Robert Del Rey: Do that specific video again and maybe a real blog. The video again instead of redoing the whole video just to showcase one step Who change that change, believe. I got it right.

Robert Del Rey: And the good thing about dividing the videos into series is that we could use those videos and upload them in a cache edu. So people can have a serious of videos to watch until they claim and nfd. That's another idea maybe for another discussion but yeah, I do like this idea of breaking it into a smaller pieces of content. Awesome. Thank you so much.

Robert Del Rey: Let's see what one thing that always will not always usually when I'm doing a video about console and I need to do a deployment, sometimes I have some Akt in my wallet. Wait, let me say that again. In the wallet that I use to create videos, not my personal wallet, right? I have some AKP there, so I just usually use that dust and I'm able to do whatever I want to do in the tutorial. But I noticed some people, for example, in a cash silly, we had a quest of doing a video about a cash. And some people did a video about console

Robert Del Rey: And something will happen is that they access the platform, they access the templates, they were almost ready to do the deployment. But they stopped in the pain, for the deployment part in the 0.58 to pay for the deployment. So having said that the question that I have is, let me know, guys, do you think it's better to have a video about how to fund your wallet included, in the Cash console video, or we just need to assume or we would just need to let them know to have funds in their wallets before doing the deployment.

Robert Del Rey: On my own personal experience. I mean, I guess here we are all very savvy with technology. We know our way to get around and usually when people need to get funds for something, they find a way to do that. I just don't know. the amount of people that would really need us to explain them how to get a 18. So yeah, I leave this up to your consideration.


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: A video on how to fund in your Akt while I guess it will be useful. I don't know how useful it will be to have it inside the same Akash console video. But I do believe having a separate video on how to fund your wallet, how to buy Akt. It's always good. So I published last year. About how to stake, Akt, that video has over 5,000 views and it's incredible, but I believe the timing was right and also the value in it. I guess having a video about how to buy Akt separately will be a great year. Yep.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah. One using Coinbase would be good since we are in Coinbase. We are in crack, and also talking about the centralized exchanges, the sex, right? But let me write that down. B s, thank you so much.

Robert Del Rey: Maybe this video about forming your Akt wallet, could be a video or could be something to add in the backlog. and that is something that I would say in the last call, we

Robert Del Rey: Created a backlog. So, all the ideas that we have about YouTube, we can add them in these backlog. So, as we progress and as we work and as we get things done We can quickly move on to the next thing we want to do and instead of thinking about what we want to do. We can just go to the backlog and Which item Would bring more value to a cache next

Robert Del Rey: Yes, I will definitely add that. To the backyard.

Robert Del Rey: Right.

Robert Del Rey: But if we have a great idea here, thank you for the insights B's. I guess the last question I have is How much do you think we should pay for? Let's say.

Robert Del Rey: For a 10 to 15 minutes, explain your video about a cash console.

Robert Del Rey: there is another thing we need to check out, I will try to get some quotes

Robert Del Rey: But I can share them in the next call, right? Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: yeah, even though at the moment, this is something that we're doing totally voluntarily with no pay. The plan is in the future to have a team. Working in a cash YouTube. This is something that Tyler has a spoken about and That's the reason why I'm asking, how much will that cost? So we can have a good idea in case they ask us.

Robert Del Rey: But yet. I would get those quotes. I actually use this space a lot fiber in fiber, you can find whatever. thing related to freelancing anything. You want to do in a contract, you can get Any freelancing fiber? This is A free plug. I'm not getting paid for fiber. First thing in this, Argue meaning, in terms of the silic campaign or is this a separate payment?

Robert Del Rey: Okay. I understand where you coming from. If the payment for this video is coming from the sealy price full, if that was the question. we will need to get new budget for you to separately. Because, we have YouTube, we have Silly has silly money. But we need money for you to so yeah, long answer short. Yeah, it's gonna be a separate payment coming from a different source. Not the silly price. Okay. Awesome. That I got it. okay.


### 00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: Very productive so far. Thank you guys. yeah, the dust was all the questions that I have in details about a cash console Prater. I know Creator is changing soon for, sure, because I spoke with you are from Peter, and yeah, he told me that they're playing on my grading very soon. Are going to migrate into console or something like that. So, I guess as soon as that happens, we will get into action and do these videos.

Robert Del Rey: The fourth point I had was about explaining the deployments, paying for the certificate pain, for the deposit, how you pick the best beats or the best providers and paying the lease, right? I believe those are topics. We can have In the Cash console video for sure.

Robert Del Rey: Great Great Question, B. S, don't take my word for it, but I heard Tyler saying in a few occasions that things like in the future, they would love to Give that revenue. I don't know if it was to the community pool or divided between the community pool and they contributor. But they have plans to use that revenue for the cash community. I believe he said the same for the merger store, a cash has a store where you can buy nurse from teachers and mocks.

Robert Del Rey: so the plan is to have the community working in YouTube, have the community working in the shop and hopefully I stream of income is created and that income can go to the community pool and maybe can Self-sustain I don't know, something like that. He said maybe we can write this down and ask him in the next YouTube call or just send him in the chat. But yeah, I believe we are remembering the same like he suggested something that they're about the Revenue and YouTube. Let's see.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah. I think I remember Tyler suggesting that revenue from YouTube, go to Community Pool but it might be worth thinking about diverting some to the creators. Yeah, I totally agree with that And let me tell you the Cash YouTube channel. We have over 3,000 subscribers.

Robert Del Rey: Which is the minimum we need to Apply to the in the YouTube Partners Program, Basically, you can get more monetization for your videos. You can add ads to your videos. And also if you have a shop the Ash Shop, we can link it to the cash videos on YouTube and people can click on those videos and go directly to the shop and they can buy directly in YouTube, recycling. I don't know if you seen on Instagram in Instagram, you can see some shop posts, you see the picture and you can see the price. And when you click it, you can do the checkout right away on Instagram. It's the same for you in the YouTube partners program.

Robert Del Rey: But we need to get there, so For the subscribers part. we are eligible. Let me show you instead. I believe sometimes I just talk to much instead of showing you, Let's see. Let me show you a picture is worth a thousand words, And This is for you guys. Again, thank you for joining those checking the recording later can also see this but basically only you can see this because Most of the people don't join to this type of things so you can see these are the analytics of a cache. We got 3,692 subscribers which is nice. And worries the partners program, one second. That's what you


### 00:30:00

Robert Del Rey: you go to earn, and you can see here the eligibility We have It's 500 subscribers We need to upload at least three videos in the last 90 days. We have uploaded a video since a cash accelerate sumit. So that's why it shows zero. So when we upload videos from the sitting comedy call, we are going to have enough videos to get this check. The watch hours, this is in the last year, we have to have 3,000 watch hours. so, This is an easy one to get. Again, we haven't uploaded a video in 90 days at least and still we have over a thousand watch hours.

Robert Del Rey: So this one is another one that's easy to get the one that is going to be tricky. It's the one for the shorts. We need at least three million shorts views. to get to this point when we get all these four, we will be able to get ads to get ads revenue and To link the stores, with the cash YouTube. So Yeah, if you never seen this before, this is how the earn page looks like on YouTube. So yeah, yeah, really cool. So can you imagine that? I guess if we can make this happen in monetize this channel,

Robert Del Rey: I guess we're gonna be one of the few projects that can say that. I honestly don't recall any project that gives revenue back to the community these kind of revenue things for the community. Usually how you get revenue in other protocols is by lending your crypto or by a staking, right or locking your funds. list, this is another way that we can try to get revenue from my Let's see, it's very exciting if you think about it. So basically our mission is make this channel blow and when this channel blows we get paid or something like that, All right. I'll stop sharing now. Yeah. Okay. All right, guys.

Robert Del Rey: that's not all I have before wrapping up. I have something to show you. Yeah, again I will share my screen again. I hope you don't mind.

Robert Del Rey: Let me know if I'm sharing. Okay, this is how the top right? Maybe I love the office. It's a good show.

Robert Del Rey: That was quick. Okay. yeah, we need to update these B. S. Remember, we spoke about uploading this banner. I need to follow up with Dennis on that.

Robert Del Rey: Or maybe if we have his blessing, we can just go ahead and do it selves. I don't mind at all, but yeah, the banner up here. So yeah, what I wanted to show you is that Greg had a talk recently in Talking 2049. They published this video yesterday in a cache twitter, they retweeted this So, nobody told me this. So I just went ahead and searched for that video on YouTube and added to the Feature Videos playlist, to give you a little context. The Feature Videos playlist is a video. Sorry, it's a playlist that we have


### 00:35:00

Shows 16, 6000 views alien traits, you might hear about aliot rates before us 30,000 views. So yeah, those videos about a cash. That appear in other channels and get good traction over a thousand views. We are adding them here. Let's see how this one performs. But yesterday, it had 50 views and today, it has over 200. So, yeah, that was one quick update one quick thing. I wanted to share with you about Akash YouTube, This is talking 2049, I'll be on the lookout to add more feature videos in the future.
