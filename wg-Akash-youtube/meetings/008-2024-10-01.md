## Meeting Notes

- **Steering Committee Video Update**:
  - Robert presented the latest updates on the steering committee videos. A total of 19 steering committee videos have been edited, including trimming dead air at the beginning and end and adding an intro/outro animation.
  - Periodic call-to-action reminders appear every five minutes to encourage subscriptions and interactions. These include reminders about following Akash on social media.
  - Robert is awaiting Tyler’s approval to make these videos public. They are currently unlisted, viewable only via shared links.

- **Akash Console and Praetor Video Plans**:
  - Robert discussed creating a series of videos for Akash’s primary tools, Akash Console and Praetor, noting that a single, comprehensive video might be challenging to keep updated.
  - B S suggested breaking down the content into smaller segments, making it easier to update individual videos if features change.
  - Robert will prepare initial drafts covering the Akash Console’s deployment features, templates, and setup procedures. He also plans to confirm if any significant updates are forthcoming for either tool to avoid creating outdated content.

- **Funding Video for Wallet Setup**:
  - There was a discussion about including a separate video to guide users on funding their Akash wallet, specifically for new users who may face difficulties during deployments due to insufficient funds.
  - Robert agreed to add this video to the YouTube backlog. B S recommended including common exchanges like Coinbase in this video for a smoother onboarding process.

- **YouTube Partner Program and Revenue Goals**:
  - Robert shared the requirements for Akash’s eligibility in the YouTube Partner Program, including subscriber count, video upload frequency, watch hours, and shorts views.
  - The Akash YouTube channel currently meets the subscriber threshold (over 3,600) but needs more recent uploads and higher engagement with shorts to qualify.
  - There was excitement about potential revenue, which could support both the Akash community pool and content creators directly, depending on future budget allocations.

- **Backlog and Content Planning**:
  - Robert emphasized the importance of the YouTube backlog document to track content ideas and prioritize tasks. It will include ideas such as wallet funding, tutorial series for Akash Console, and other educational videos.
  - B S shared the backlog link in the chat, enabling participants to add or review future content ideas.

- **Featured Videos Playlist Update**:
  - Robert added new external videos to the Featured Videos playlist, including a recent presentation by Akash’s Greg at Token 2049.
  - This playlist aims to spotlight Akash-related videos hosted on other channels that garner significant viewership, further promoting Akash Network’s content.
