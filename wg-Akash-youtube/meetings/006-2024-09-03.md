## Meeting Notes

- **Steering Committee Call Uploads**:
  - Robert confirmed that he now has access to download the steering committee calls. These videos will be uploaded to YouTube soon, after adding the necessary graphic assets.
  - There are ongoing efforts to create the required thumbnails, intro cards, and closing cards, which will be used for all the videos. A community member is working on this, and Robert is waiting for their submission.

- **Automating Video Edits**:
  - A question was raised by oo o about automating the addition of intro and outro cards across multiple videos. Robert explained that currently, this needs to be done manually, as YouTube doesnâ€™t allow post-upload edits of this nature.
  - He encouraged the group to share any tools that might facilitate bulk editing but will proceed manually for now.

- **Task Management and Backlog**:
  - Robert proposed creating a backlog document to track future projects and ideas, ensuring that important tasks are not forgotten.
  - He mentioned the possibility of using project management tools such as Asana or GitHub Projects. oo o suggested that GitHub Projects could be a suitable option, especially since Akash already uses GitHub for other purposes.
  - The backlog will include tasks like YouTube collaborations and new video ideas, allowing the team to prioritize and execute them in the future.

- **Omniflix TV Update**:
  - Robert shared the good news that Akash Network now has an official channel on Omniflix TV, a streaming platform in the Cosmos ecosystem.
  - All Akash videos uploaded to YouTube will also be posted on Omniflix TV, potentially increasing the channel's reach within the Cosmos community.
  - This effort supports Omniflix, an old partner of Akash.

- **YouTube Comments**:
  - Robert addressed recent YouTube comments, including a frequently asked question about whether someone can use a regular computer with a 360 graphic card on the Akash network.
  - A generic response was developed, encouraging everyone to provide what resources they have but also explaining that higher-capacity equipment offers better chances of earning AKT.
  - Each response includes links to Akash documentation and an invitation to join the Akash Discord for further technical assistance.

- **Call Frequency Update**:
  - The group discussed the recent change in meeting frequency from weekly to biweekly. Robert confirmed that this change will be reflected on the Akash Discord to avoid confusion.

## Action Items
- **Robert Del Rey**:
  - Continue working on uploading the steering committee call videos after receiving the required graphic assets.
