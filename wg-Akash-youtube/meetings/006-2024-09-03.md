## Meeting Notes

- **Steering Committee Call Uploads**:
  - Robert confirmed that he now has access to download the steering committee calls. These videos will be uploaded to YouTube soon, after adding the necessary graphic assets.
  - There are ongoing efforts to create the required thumbnails, intro cards, and closing cards, which will be used for all the videos. A community member is working on this, and Robert is waiting for their submission.

- **Automating Video Edits**:
  - A question was raised by oo o about automating the addition of intro and outro cards across multiple videos. Robert explained that currently, this needs to be done manually, as YouTube doesn’t allow post-upload edits of this nature.
  - He encouraged the group to share any tools that might facilitate bulk editing but will proceed manually for now.

- **Task Management and Backlog**:
  - Robert proposed creating a backlog document to track future projects and ideas, ensuring that important tasks are not forgotten.
  - He mentioned the possibility of using project management tools such as Asana or GitHub Projects. oo o suggested that GitHub Projects could be a suitable option, especially since Akash already uses GitHub for other purposes.
  - The backlog will include tasks like YouTube collaborations and new video ideas, allowing the team to prioritize and execute them in the future.

- **Omniflix TV Update**:
  - Robert shared the good news that Akash Network now has an official channel on Omniflix TV, a streaming platform in the Cosmos ecosystem.
  - All Akash videos uploaded to YouTube will also be posted on Omniflix TV, potentially increasing the channel's reach within the Cosmos community.
  - This effort supports Omniflix, an old partner of Akash.

- **YouTube Comments**:
  - Robert addressed recent YouTube comments, including a frequently asked question about whether someone can use a regular computer with a 360 graphic card on the Akash network.
  - A generic response was developed, encouraging everyone to provide what resources they have but also explaining that higher-capacity equipment offers better chances of earning AKT.
  - Each response includes links to Akash documentation and an invitation to join the Akash Discord for further technical assistance.

- **Call Frequency Update**:
  - The group discussed the recent change in meeting frequency from weekly to biweekly. Robert confirmed that this change will be reflected on the Akash Discord to avoid confusion.

## Action Items
- **Robert Del Rey**:
  - Continue working on uploading the steering committee call videos after receiving the required graphic assets.
  - Update the Akash Discord to reflect the biweekly meeting schedule.
  - Finalize a backlog document using GitHub Projects to organize future tasks for the Akash YouTube channel.

# **Transcript**

Robert Del Rey: It's been recorded and transcribed. Hello, everybody. And welcome to Hatch by weekly YouTube in this call, we discuss all things related to a cash due to We are on a mission on revamping the YouTube channel. We're focusing on improving the content quality, we want to increase the engagement and align the channel with a cash network score. Make it easier for people to find this channel and get educated about a cash. So yeah, today's agenda, it's a big short. I'm just gonna follow up on some islands from last week and some things that hopefully we will. In the following two weeks. Thank you everybody for joining.

Robert Del Rey: This call right now, live. On September 3rd. And also thank you for those listening to the recording later. We appreciate you a lot in the cash community. So, at the moment, what we're doing, We want to upload the steering commit Working group calls, that's monthly call, that happens and most of the community gets involved. Most of the core team gets involved. Most of the occasion, cider skip involved. so, To start overloading new content to the Cash YouTube channel. We want to upload the city This theory community call. so, I haven't uploaded then yet so my bad, please forgive me.

Robert Del Rey: But good news. I have access now to download those calls, I didn't have access, but now I have the access to download the files and we will Update them, in the coming days. another thing that is spending for me to get If the graphic assets at the moment, there are two people working in the graphic assets. Those are thumbnails.

Robert Del Rey: Thumbnails and intro and closing cards for the videos. So, the thumbnail is the image you see before clicking on a video. Somebody from the community is working on that. And they will send that to me.

Robert Del Rey: The intro and closing cards, It's like I don't know, Maybe you have seen a YouTube video before the person in the video, those a quick overview and then you get an in a TV channel, I don't know, an intro, right? So these persons working on an interview about a cash, so we can add that to all the videos. It's something simple. It's like a logo animation. That is going to be in all the videos. So yeah, I'm going in on those two graphic assets so that we can start uploading those Syrian community videos into their cash YouTube channel. That's the main stuff at the moment. Then we will move on to other videos, so I stay tuned for that. I will discover quickly in case. Somebody here has any question.

Robert Del Rey: I see a hand. go ahead.

oo o: So the intro and exit cards, When you're adding them, is it going to be automated?

Robert Del Rey: What you mean automated?

oo o: instead of having to do in manual one after the other is their way to do it in bulk you just select all the files and then from song so you add it to the beginning and then to the end of everything.

Robert Del Rey: let me tell you, that'd be great And if you have a tool that can live, that can help me doing something like that, please share it. But at the moment I will need to do it one by one. I will need to download the video and manually, add the intro and outer part to all the ways. Then I need to export and then I need to upload to you. In there. Yeah.

oo o: That's like a.

Robert Del Rey: it's gonna be some work. Yeah. But we can do it. And, the only reason why we're doing it that way. It's because once you upload a video to YouTube, There is no way to edit the video, doing some heavy editing. There is no way you can do that. You can add subtitles, you can add Some other stuff, some atoms, right? But you cannot do like that kind of editing once you upload a video interview. So Looking forward to get those assets this weekend and start uploading those to the channel. one thing I wanted to ask Tyler suddenly he's not here, he's on vacation.


### 00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: But I would drop it here so we can be in the recording is that I believe it's necessary that we have a backlog document. because, at the moment right now, we're just Sharing ideas and brainstorming ideas. But nothing is on any document or future reference. So, just to avoid that, we forget about any important stuff that we want to do. I believe it's important to have a back in The backlog is a document. That you add all the things that you want to do. But you cannot do right? Because An example is that right now we are working in the city community called Videos, Right? But let's say we also want to do YouTube shortly.

Robert Del Rey: And we also want to do collaboration with other YouTube. At the moment. We are not focusing on that but we understand that it's important for the channel. So, we're gonna add those items. so, once we're done with what we're doing right now, We can just go to the backlog and see what is the next thing that we should do to keep the channel? hopefully done next but yeah, I really having a vacuum of it. Yeah, you want to just turn it?

oo o: so some of these are Just this project management software.

Robert Del Rey: Come again.

oo o: What do you call it? with cards for those, you have need to do

Robert Del Rey: forget about your stuff or you're talking about asana, for example,

oo o: Yeah, something like I think asana and get similar software like that should do with that. Or I don't know if Github has something similar But asana and…

Robert Del Rey: Yeah.

oo o: if that sounds like something that you will be, the thing is. if they offer free option large enough use for a lot of people to Have access to.

oo o: .

Robert Del Rey: Yeah. And I get it and Astana has a free option but it's only 30 days that you can use it. You have all the features…

oo o: Yeah. Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: but it's only days after the 30 days you have to pay. But on github I send you to The projects used.

oo o: Okay, that

oo o: Okay okay. Yeah. Yeah. Data projects or something similar? Okay. Yes yes.

Robert Del Rey: I believe we could use the Github projects. I mean, we're using it right now but maybe you could use it a little bit more and…

oo o: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: get more advantage, a son because Applesana in the past and…

oo o: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: it's really cool to stay updated and current with the past.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks for the suggestion. So yeah, you can see in the Github board. You have items up next in progress and completed. For example, one thing I do after I'm done with the YouTube call, and the ceiling call is that I come here to this dashboard. I look for the YouTube card and I add the comments for example. Today, we have this call After this call is done, I would go to there and write something like, Hey, they had a call and we spoke about this and these and that. Yeah, and when I have a big update, I added their. So again, I believe we could use more peace or only to manage the products what you say.

oo o: Yeah, that makes sense. And actually totally forgot about guitar projects. obviously is what I've not used that much up so it a cash.

Robert Del Rey: In about Tyler. No wait. Wait.

Robert Del Rey: You are Nate, right? but, Who's Oakley? Are you okay? Also or cleanse it someone else. I believe it's someone else. Right?

So yeah, that's the cost frequency for this community efforts just so I have any news. I already told you that I'm able to download them working group videos, that's progressed. but the other good news that I have, is that Cash network. Has an official channel in omniflex TV.

oo o: Mmm.

Robert Del Rey: I mean the objective of that is basically uploading all the videos we have on YouTube. We want to upload them in public city hopefully that can get off some extra rich in the cosmos ecosystem. and yeah, we would support our omniflix partner So yeah, that's a good news there. And the reason why I say this is good news, It's because someone tried to do this in the past.

Robert Del Rey: And they open an account and everything and they took the cash username. And I couldn't get it. So last week, I just spoke with a team. They did some things in the back end and we were able to get the cash official channel. So yeah, yeah. Something to celebrate.

Hopefully we can get some support on the Twitter side of things, hopefully sack and help us sharing some things in Twitter. To get some extra rich.

So the first It is very possible that the first videos of a cash channel in Omniflicts. Are about the cash give you videos, so it's very possible that we experiment with those first.

oo o: Sorry, I keep on forget I muted. I can see your screen.

Robert Del Rey: No worries So here, this is The last comment we got from this person. Basically, the question is, Can you use a regular computer with a 360

Robert Del Rey: Graphic card I guess and put it on the cash network.

Robert Del Rey: So, that was the question and Instead of replying yes or no. This is the answer that we gave this person. This is gonna be the generic answer or these kind of questions, depending on the question, we're gonna have different answers both about installing equipment to provide to the network. This is the generic answer. We came up with and I will read it out loud. It says, Thanks for watching out. And we encourage everybody to provide whatever resources they have available on a cash. However, the capacity of your equipment, the better chances of you earning aka So this is like the answer so they understand. That. Yeah, you can connect any computer onto a cash. but,

Robert Del Rey: That doesn't necessarily mean that they're gonna get the man for your resources. If you're involved in the community, You can notice that I actually is very involved in getting high and equipment to provide to the network. But They can join. They can connect and they can learn what they have. So here we added the documentation. Here's how to get started. And lastly, an invitation to join the cash discord. their cash discovery is super focused on development so this is the best places to route people to answer their technical questions. So yeah, that's another update about the YouTube initiative. Slowly, we're gonna respond to all of the comments.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, hopefully more common score, And I will stop presenting. so yeah guys, that's all that I had for you today, I gave you an update in the graphic assets and the seating community called Videos, we'll spoke a leader about having a backlog. Using project managers tools against, I will need to chat with Tyler to see what he thinks about it. And I also gave you some good news, like the Cash on the Divisional. The access to download the working group called Videos, and the comments and replies into the Cash YouTube videos. So yeah, one thing I'm gonna take action on is making sure the setting on this core reflects this call as a weekly call instead of a weekly.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, hopefully we meet again in two weeks and that's gonna be Tuesday the 17th Hopefully, we have more updates and more stuff to show off here. Again, If you have any comments, thoughts feedbacks questions concerned, regrets feel free to share them in the YouTube working group channel in a caches discord. Or send me again.
