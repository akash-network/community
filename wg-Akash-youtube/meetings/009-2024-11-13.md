## Meeting Notes

### **Phase 1 Updates**
- Robert reported significant progress in cleaning up the Akash YouTube channel, including:
  - Organizing videos into playlists by theme.
  - Updating the introduction video with a talk from the Akash Accelerate Summit.
  - Redesigning thumbnails to align with Akash’s branding.
- The main outstanding task is updating the channel banner, which remains a priority for the next steps.

### **Phase 2 Proposal**
- Robert presented a proposal for Phase 2, aiming to make Akash YouTube a hub for educational content. Key deliverables include:
  - Producing four technical educational videos per month.
  - Hosting two technical workshops per month on Akash tools or relevant topics.
  - Leveraging high-quality production to address feedback regarding the readability and accessibility of existing content.
- The goal is to use the next 4–6 months to:
  - Increase views to 50,000.
  - Grow watch hours to 5,000.
  - Gain 2,000 new subscribers.

### **Separation of YouTube Channels**
- Robert suggested splitting the Akash YouTube content into:
  - An **official Akash Network channel** for polished technical videos.
  - A **community channel** for working group calls, SIG recordings, and community-created content.
- The rationale is to maintain a clear and professional image on the official channel while allowing creativity and diversity on the community channel.
- Tyler highlighted the importance of keeping the Akash Network channel as a community resource and integrating the proposed community channel closely with existing efforts.

### **Community Collaboration**
- Robert introduced a potential team for Phase 2:
  - Himself, Piyush ("Black Panther"), and Akash Alpha, with roles spanning video editing, animation, and technical content.
- Tyler supported leveraging community talents and suggested outreach to identify additional contributors for content creation, editing, and documentation.

### **Goals and Future Plans**
- The team’s target metrics include making the channel eligible for the YouTube Partner Program to enable monetization and integration with the Akash merchandise shop.
- Discussions will continue in SIG Design to finalize deliverables and align with core team strategies.

### **Cadence for Meetings**
- Robert proposed continuing the current three-week meeting cadence, increasing frequency if needed during later phases of Phase 2.

## Action Items
- **Robert Del Rey**:
  - Finalize the banner design for the YouTube channel.
  - Share the Phase 2 proposal document for feedback on GitHub and Discord.
  - Continue assembling the team for educational content production.
  - Draft initial scripts and topics for the first technical videos.

- **Tyler Wright**:
  - Facilitate alignment between the proposed community channel and Akash Network’s strategic goals.
  - Identify and connect additional community contributors with Robert.

- **B S**:
  - Collaborate with Robert to finalize the banner and thumbnails.
  - Participate in discussions during the SIG Design meeting for further alignment.

- **M R**:
  - Review the Phase 2 proposal and provide insights or suggestions.

- **General**:
  - Promote the Akash YouTube channel across personal and professional networks to meet growth targets.
  - Encourage community members to join working group discussions and contribute to the channel’s development.

# **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to the working group for the Akash YouTube channel. It is November 13th. 24. This is a working group that came out of the SIG design special interest group. The goal of this working group is really to overhaul and continue to monitor and maintain the Akash YouTube channel. As we have discussed a number of times, a Kos YouTube channel could be a great resource for exploration around the just introduction to the Akash network. And then the goal is to find people in the community that can help contribute to creating videos that can be hosted on the Akash YouTube. find people that can help edit videos from various talks etc.

Tyler Wright: so that again we can continue to develop and evolve the Akash YouTube as just another resource for people to technically understand Akos at the highest level and all in between. Robert has been leading a number of efforts through some work that he has talked about insect design. there was a community support funds that he was able to leverage to do phase one. I want to get phase one around the steering committees live here today. my hope is that some members of the sig design will be able to join here today. Otherwise, I want to do it during sig design and get again some of the work that Robert has done around the steering committee videos live.

Tyler Wright: I also want to talk about the banner on the homepage and start to get some action items around some additional content. I know we should clean up the Akash YouTube channel homepage so that it has the most up-to-date information. I know there's a number of talks that have happened over the last couple weeks. Dennis has created a bunch of videos for the Akash Accelerate that I don't believe live yet. so there's a number of items that we can do to improve the Akash YouTube channel immediately based upon work that's already been done. And then I would love to talk about work that we can start to think about for the future in terms of next steps and phases. I just want to see if there's anything that else that anybody wants to discuss here today.

Tyler Wright: Robert, I know that you typically have an agenda for some of these meetings and so I don't want to take away from your agenda,…

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: but those are some of the things that I was hoping to talk about and get accomplished today.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you,…

Robert Del Rey: Tyler. yes, I guess phase one was really nice in helping us organizing and come up with a plan for the YouTube page. we did some cleanup with some of the older videos. we also came up with a playlist. We created a new playlist and starting arranging videos based on the name of the playlist. we also changed the introduction video that people see when they join the Aash YouTube channel. We updated it for one of the talks that Greg had in the Aash accelerate summit.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, basically what I'm looking forward the most is what you were saying about the graphics. we are still missing the banner on the YouTube channel, but that's mainly it. I believe for the thumbnails, we basically nailed the design. I still haven't got word on Dennis on that, but the thumbnail design looks very similar to what we had, so it doesn't disrupt the current aesthetics of the channel. so yeah, I guess phase one was really solid I guess we can take that to the SIG design call, but what I mainly want to talk about was about phase two of the Aash YouTube channel.

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: Excellent.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah. …

Robert Del Rey: where do I start? All right. So, yeah. Tyler, we are totally in line when you say that a cash YouTube channel should be like a channel where people can find resources about a cashache. it should be a place where people can find technical information about the things they can do on a cache network and should be like an extent of us on discord we have a lot of developer support on Twitter there are a lot of integration news partnerships news and I believe we're lacking a little bit in the educational aspects.


### 00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: We have tried to do educational campaigns in the past, but I guess YouTube can be a great place to put our efforts in spreading education about a cashache through professional educational videos. So yeah, I have a proposal for you guys and this is about the Aash technical YouTube channel. basically our plan is to expand a cache YouTube and we want to create consistent high quality educational content about the tools you have in a cache and about the capabilities of a cache network.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, if you go to the current estate of the Akash YouTube channel, you barely can find some up to-date videos about And one thing I noticed is that some of the videos don't have of the best quality. actually we got some comments saying that we should do some videos again because people can't read the fonts in the videos. so yeah, I guess there is a significant need for professional n technical videos showcasing a cash network. So, what I'm want to propose to you is that we can assemble a team of people. I've been thinking about some people in the community that can help us making this a reality.

Robert Del Rey: initially I want to run phase 2 between four to 6 months and what we want to deliver to Akash it's basically four technical educational videos per month meaning that each week Aash is going to have a new technical video uploaded in the channel and besides that we also want to provide two technical workshops per month covering the key developments of Aash or any desired topic that we discussed in the Akash YouTube working group. this is another idea. I mean I just gave you the overview of what we want to do with the Aash technical YouTube channel and this is just a crazy idea. I'm going to drop it now and you can let me know what you think.

Robert Del Rey: But we believe that it would be better if the official Aash channel stays as a technical library for videos and we create another Aash community channel where we can upload the working group calls, the special interest group calls and also community members content that they do. And the reasoning behind that is that we can keep the official Lakash YouTube channel clean with only technical videos and if people want to go deeper and find other aspects of the Akash community, they can go to this Akash community YouTube channel. It's an idea that we have, but if you believe that it's better to have all types of content in one single channel, I'm also down for that.

Robert Del Rey: 

Robert Del Rey: So I will stop real quickly and after this overview maybe you can let me know your initial thoughts about this proposal.

Tyler Wright: 

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, go ahead.

Tyler Wright: I like the idea.

Tyler Wright: Is there a brand that you are thinking about developing or is this something that you'll be starting from scratch

Robert Del Rey: Actually since Cosmoverse, I've been working on this draft and discussing about the ideas, about the content that we will cover, about the cost like the proposal is mostly ready to share to the world. the people that I'm working with right now, it's me.

Robert Del Rey: We also have Push also known as Ball Panther and another person is Akash Alpha. you might have seen him on Twitter. he's very avid with editing and animations and I believe he will do a great job as an editor and to record this technical stuff. I believe Push and the team can help us out nailing that. yeah. Yeah. also, I don't know the possibility of this, but I would like to have Sack, you Tyler, and also Dennis helping us out as maybe our project sponsors so you can guide us and make sure that we remain aligned with the Aashore team. I mean, we are experienced insiders. I've been an insider for two years. B Panther, I believe it's older than me in the community.


### 00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: 

Robert Del Rey: Akash Alpha is new but his commitment speaks for itself but still we would like to remain close to the core team as possible to have guidance and alignment and tips and just make sure that this campaign can be the more satisfactory as possible for the Aash network.

Tyler Wright: 

Robert Del Rey: I don't know what you mean about working with a brand honestly you refer to an agency or something like that.

Tyler Wright: No, no.

Tyler Wright: As you were talking about this kind of separate YouTube channel, I was thinking about somebody like Akash Alpha that already has their own brand being built and is doing their own content separate of obviously the official Akos Network social media and really the folks that you described, yourself, Bold Panther, Akash Alpha I think would be a great group of people to collaborate on these kinds of ideas.

Tyler Wright: So, I was wondering were you going to call the channel, Akash blah blah blah, but it sounds like you all have the three people in question can come up with a brand that can grow its own wings and…

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: be closely aligned with the core team but again have its own identity.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, man.

Robert Del Rey: In that case, we haven't talked much about the branding. We just call it the Aash community YouTube channel. for the moment, it's a placeholder name, I guess. But we can put some thought into branding if necessary.

Tyler Wright: My only concern with that is the Akash network YouTube channel is supposed to be an Akash community channel. That's why we're having these working group sessions so that anybody from the community can talk about ideas, share ideas for that specific channel. It sounds like it'll be creative directed and…

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: have ownership and direction from Bull Panther, Robert Del Rey, and Akash Akos Alpha.

Robert Del Rey: I got my unit.

Tyler Wright: So that might have a different voice and message and kind of direction than the official Akash networks which should be communityowned which is why we're meeting about it here.

Robert Del Rey: Yes. Yes. That's why the idea to have a separate channel came from because P and I were talking about that making the Aash network channel a technical library where people can only find these kind of technical videos.

Robert Del Rey: 

Robert Del Rey: And the good thing I have about having a separate community channel is that it will give us some space to be creative, improvise and upload all kinds of videos about a cashache in another channel. So that is the main reasoning behind it.

Tyler Wright: Sounds good to me.

Robert Del Rey: Awesome, I'm happy you like it. I have the draft document. We are still trying to nail down the costs and some other information but what we want to do the objective the timeline even the contents that we want to cover first we already have them.

Robert Del Rey: so yeah so yeah some goals that we have is that for example at the time that I was finishing up the document yesterday a cashache got almost 20,000 views in the last year with 600 new subscribers in the last year and 1,200 watch hours in the last year. So, we're planning to use these numbers to measure our success. But some initial goals that we have is raise the views to 50,000 in the next four to six months that we're going to run this campaign. We want to increase the views to 50,000 views, the watch hours to 5,000 watch hours, and try to get at least 2,000 subscribers in the next four to six months.


### 00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: it's a big goal but we feel confident in ourselves in the team that we are assembling we call it A team and also having these numbers will make Akash eligible to become a YouTube partner and by becoming a YouTube partner Aash can monetize from ads on YouTube so we can get some income from YouTube and also we can link external shops like the Aash shop and sell a cash merch directly on YouTube. So that's why also we came up with these numbers. again it's a big goal but we feel confident that we can make it happen. So I can share the link with you so you can have a look at the document and yeah you can let us know what you think man.

Robert Del Rey: 

Robert Del Rey: we believe this can be very very beneficial not only for a cash but for the people discovering this YouTube channel there are some projects that I can share as example also that you go to their channels and maybe they don't have many videos but you can learn all that there is to learn about those projects in the 15 to 20 videos that they have available and those videos again cover critical aspects of the project how the project works what things can you do as a developer in a project and…

Tyler Wright: Love it.

Robert Del Rey: and things like that. So yeah. Yeah. thank you for coming to my tech And the timeline I know that for the holidays it's the almost December and people like to take breaks and rest during the holidays.

Robert Del Rey: 

Robert Del Rey: So we want to bring this up to discussion on GitHub for Dember. and hopefully share the proposal on chain we can start January 2025 full esteem with a plan with a budget and with the people ready to make this happen.

Tyler Wright: 

Tyler Wright: Love it.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks I appreciate your support Tyler and everybody's support on this. again, this is not set in a stone yet. So if you guys listening now or listening to the recording, you have an extra idea,…

Robert Del Rey: feedbacks or maybe you have experience working on YouTube, it would be awesome if you can reach out and get involved.

Tyler Wright: Yeah. On that note,…

Robert Del Rey: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I know Robert, you went to Cosmoverse. it was always great to see if there's anybody else out in the community that is looking to get involved in newer pro in projects. Obviously, Akasha has been around here for a while, so it's not newer, but again, we're certainly at the point where there are funds available to those that want to make contributions, especially in the areas of video content creation, editing, technical documentation, writing, etc. So, please reach out to myself, Robert, anybody that you feel comfortable with on Discord. join these meetings, look to get involved.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, Robert, I might say save some of the agenda items around getting the steering committee page live and some of the other things for SIG design because some of the folks that were going to be here have conflicts now just trying to get some design deliverables over the finish line.

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: Are you able to join SIG design in 38 minutes? Okay.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, I'll be there.

Robert Del Rey: I'll be there. I told P and Akash Alpha to join this call, but maybe they had conflicts as So I will join to the design, but I will tell them if they can also join to the design call. So maybe we can keep chatting about this and graphics and stuff in the design. Awesome.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, that would be great. as of right now, I believe that this meeting is weekly.

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: No, it's a one-off meeting.

Robert Del Rey: At the moment I believe every three weeks works good based on the stage that we are in this project.

Tyler Wright: It's a one-off meeting. Do we want to It's every 3 weeks on Wednesday. Is that a good cadence for this meeting? as we continue to move forward and we can just again meet every three weeks. or do we want to meet more regularly?


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: Maybe after we start the discussions about our future plans maybe we can increase the candence cabins to a weekly setting…

Tyler Wright: Excellent.

Robert Del Rey: but at the moment I believe three weeks is good and any topic that maybe we don't chat about we can also discuss it in the design call.

Robert Del Rey: 

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, they're very handtoand I believe.

Tyler Wright: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, Thank you for taking care of that tie and yeah. Yeah, that's all for me at the moment.

Tyler Wright: Me as well. again some folks if people have time please join SIG design think we'll talk a little bit more about just again implementation and not Dennis Robert if you can be screen share ready I would love to get some of those things from unlisted to listed and live during SIG design because we have a number of stakeholders that will be there I would also be interested BS if you can make it yourself. I know that previously you and I have been working together on some ideas around like a digest or a blog that does a roundup of the SIGs and working groups. I would love to revisit that especially with Dennis and some other members of the community that can help edit it.

Tyler Wright: 

Tyler Wright: I would love for this to be an item that, BSU or somebody else or a couple people from the community can own outright and then, make a PR and then if there edits that need to be made, I can look at that PR and just make those edits and help merge it. but again, I would love to get that off the ground because I think it's important asset and something the community has been asking for. and something that a team or a couple individual contributors can certainly add value to. So we can talk about that a little bit more in SIG design as well. Is there anything else as it pertains to Akos YouTube that anybody wants to discuss right now that we haven't talked about already? Cool. All right.

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: We'll meet here every go ahead, Robert.

Robert Del Rey: …

Robert Del Rey: I can do a shameless plug if I went to Cosmover 2024 this year. Thank you so much, Akash, for making it a reality. And as every year, I came up with an unoffial the after movie, it's live. So I will share the link and if you have time you can see it and yeah that's that because if the video is on YouTube that's why I'm sharing it here on the YouTube working group call. All right forgive me.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah that's all for me. thank you for joining guys and see you in the next call. So you're in the design call.

Tyler Wright: Excellent. Thank you all.

Tyler Wright: Talk to you soon.
