## Meeting Notes

### **Phase 1 Updates**
- Robert reported significant progress in cleaning up the Akash YouTube channel, including:
  - Organizing videos into playlists by theme.
  - Updating the introduction video with a talk from the Akash Accelerate Summit.
  - Redesigning thumbnails to align with Akash’s branding.
- The main outstanding task is updating the channel banner, which remains a priority for the next steps.

### **Phase 2 Proposal**
- Robert presented a proposal for Phase 2, aiming to make Akash YouTube a hub for educational content. Key deliverables include:
  - Producing four technical educational videos per month.
  - Hosting two technical workshops per month on Akash tools or relevant topics.
  - Leveraging high-quality production to address feedback regarding the readability and accessibility of existing content.
- The goal is to use the next 4–6 months to:
  - Increase views to 50,000.
  - Grow watch hours to 5,000.
  - Gain 2,000 new subscribers.

### **Separation of YouTube Channels**
- Robert suggested splitting the Akash YouTube content into:
  - An **official Akash Network channel** for polished technical videos.
  - A **community channel** for working group calls, SIG recordings, and community-created content.
- The rationale is to maintain a clear and professional image on the official channel while allowing creativity and diversity on the community channel.
- Tyler highlighted the importance of keeping the Akash Network channel as a community resource and integrating the proposed community channel closely with existing efforts.

### **Community Collaboration**
- Robert introduced a potential team for Phase 2:
  - Himself, Piyush ("Black Panther"), and Akash Alpha, with roles spanning video editing, animation, and technical content.
- Tyler supported leveraging community talents and suggested outreach to identify additional contributors for content creation, editing, and documentation.

### **Goals and Future Plans**
- The team’s target metrics include making the channel eligible for the YouTube Partner Program to enable monetization and integration with the Akash merchandise shop.
- Discussions will continue in SIG Design to finalize deliverables and align with core team strategies.

### **Cadence for Meetings**
- Robert proposed continuing the current three-week meeting cadence, increasing frequency if needed during later phases of Phase 2.
