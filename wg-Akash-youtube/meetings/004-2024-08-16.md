## Meeting Notes

- **Recap of Last Week’s Topics**:
  - Robert Del Rey received admin access to the Akash YouTube channel.
  - There was discussion on needing graphic assets such as thumbnails and opening/closing cards.
  - Video descriptions were updated to include timestamps, links to Akash Network’s social media, Akash Console link, and disclaimers. The group agreed on including disclaimers for educational purposes or when presenting beta tools.
  - A feature videos playlist with high-view-count videos was created, along with plans for adding community-driven content.
  - Shorts are considered part of the content strategy, though none were posted yet.

- **YouTube Content Strategy**:
  - Tyler Wright emphasized the importance of creating deliverables from previous discussions, especially for steering committee meetings.
  - He proposed uploading all past steering committee recordings and organizing them into a playlist with proper titles and descriptions, starting from historical content.
  - There was agreement that while full recordings would be uploaded, a short branded intro/outro should be added for consistency, though minimal time would be spent editing.
  
- **Presentation of Shorts**:
  - Robert Del Rey presented three sample shorts, showcasing different styles and music. Due to technical issues, the audio could not initially be heard during the screen share, but Robert eventually uploaded them to YouTube as unlisted for the team to review.
  - The shorts highlighted key features like Kubernetes integration and Akash’s original code being used by major companies.
  - There was positive feedback from the group on the content and value of the shorts, but the animations were noted as being too fast, and subtitles were too large.
  - Robert suggested using Premiere Pro's auto-ducking feature for better audio balance and noted that future edits could address these concerns.

- **Feedback on Shorts**:
  - Tyler and the others liked the shorts but suggested a smoother transition to a closing screen with Akash branding to avoid abrupt endings. Robert agreed and suggested waiting for the official graphic assets before finalizing the format.
  - They also discussed adding more icons to maintain viewer engagement, especially given the short-form content’s nature.

- **Community Engagement**:
  - Tyler encouraged more public discussions in the Discord channels rather than private DMs to engage the broader community and activate participation.
  - Robert emphasized that public activity on channels helps maintain interest and attract new members.

## Action Items
- **Robert Del Rey**:
  - Finalize and upload all steering committee calls to the YouTube playlist with consistent naming conventions.
  - Add a branded intro/outro to each video.
  - Edit the presented shorts based on feedback: slow down animations, resize subtitles, and adjust audio using auto-ducking.
  - Separate the three compiled shorts into individual videos and prepare them for publishing.
  
- **Tyler Wright**:
  - Coordinate with Robert on finalizing descriptions and content for the steering committee playlist.
  - Promote the new YouTube content via marketing efforts.

- **General**:
  - Continue public discussions in the Akash YouTube working group Discord to increase visibility and encourage community participation.
