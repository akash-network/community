## Meeting Notes

- **Recap of Last Week’s Topics**:
  - Robert Del Rey received admin access to the Akash YouTube channel.
  - There was discussion on needing graphic assets such as thumbnails and opening/closing cards.
  - Video descriptions were updated to include timestamps, links to Akash Network’s social media, Akash Console link, and disclaimers. The group agreed on including disclaimers for educational purposes or when presenting beta tools.
  - A feature videos playlist with high-view-count videos was created, along with plans for adding community-driven content.
  - Shorts are considered part of the content strategy, though none were posted yet.

- **YouTube Content Strategy**:
  - Tyler Wright emphasized the importance of creating deliverables from previous discussions, especially for steering committee meetings.
  - He proposed uploading all past steering committee recordings and organizing them into a playlist with proper titles and descriptions, starting from historical content.
  - There was agreement that while full recordings would be uploaded, a short branded intro/outro should be added for consistency, though minimal time would be spent editing.
  
- **Presentation of Shorts**:
  - Robert Del Rey presented three sample shorts, showcasing different styles and music. Due to technical issues, the audio could not initially be heard during the screen share, but Robert eventually uploaded them to YouTube as unlisted for the team to review.
  - The shorts highlighted key features like Kubernetes integration and Akash’s original code being used by major companies.
  - There was positive feedback from the group on the content and value of the shorts, but the animations were noted as being too fast, and subtitles were too large.
  - Robert suggested using Premiere Pro's auto-ducking feature for better audio balance and noted that future edits could address these concerns.

- **Feedback on Shorts**:
  - Tyler and the others liked the shorts but suggested a smoother transition to a closing screen with Akash branding to avoid abrupt endings. Robert agreed and suggested waiting for the official graphic assets before finalizing the format.
  - They also discussed adding more icons to maintain viewer engagement, especially given the short-form content’s nature.

- **Community Engagement**:
  - Tyler encouraged more public discussions in the Discord channels rather than private DMs to engage the broader community and activate participation.
  - Robert emphasized that public activity on channels helps maintain interest and attract new members.

## Action Items
- **Robert Del Rey**:
  - Finalize and upload all steering committee calls to the YouTube playlist with consistent naming conventions.
  - Add a branded intro/outro to each video.
  - Edit the presented shorts based on feedback: slow down animations, resize subtitles, and adjust audio using auto-ducking.
  - Separate the three compiled shorts into individual videos and prepare them for publishing.
  
- **Tyler Wright**:
  - Coordinate with Robert on finalizing descriptions and content for the steering committee playlist.
  - Promote the new YouTube content via marketing efforts.

- **General**:
  - Continue public discussions in the Akash YouTube working group Discord to increase visibility and encourage community participation.
 
# **Transcript**

Robert Del Rey: I think

Robert Del Rey: Right everybody. Happy Tuesday. And welcome to this. Addition of the Akash YouTube working group, I believe this is the support call so far.

Robert Del Rey: within making process planning brainstorming and forming this effort to rebound the Akash YouTube channel. So I like to start. By recapping the topics from last week. and then we can move on to the topics from this week this week I have

Robert Del Rey: a sample presentation for you I made some shorts and I will share my screen to share those shorts with you so you can let me know what you think about them.

Robert Del Rey: So before doing that last week, we confirm I got the admin access to the cash YouTube channel. We also briefly spoke about the graphic assets that we will need. to complement the videos some of those assets include thumbnails and opening and closing cards for the videos.

Robert Del Rey: I didn't spoke with Dennis this week. So hopefully we would get an update on that soon. Moving on with the descriptions and tiles for the videos last week. We showed case. how the new description format will look we spoke about the description adding timestamps. Having the links to the different Akash Network social media channels. And also we added links to existing content along with discussing a disclaimer.

Robert Del Rey: We can agree that having a not Financial advice disclaimer would give maybe the running impression, but we did agree on having a disclaimer on education beta for example, if we have a tool that we're presenting in a video and it's on better. We agreed that it would make sense to have a disclaimer saying hey this tool is even better. It might have errors at their own risk. Or if it's an educational video having a disclaimer saying that this information is for educational purposes. something along those lines what we added new to the description was the cash dot console link.

Robert Del Rey: To make sure all the description can have that link and people have a quick access to the cash console. Which is the flagship tool let's say for my cash Network. So yeah, the study if you want to see the description entitles documents, you can find it in the Channel plan document I will send both links right now as I always do.

Robert Del Rey: Next to that we went over the YouTube video playlist and the sections we discussed on ideas about the different topics. in the playlist We mainly spoke about deployments and tutorials. Also about other kinds of videos like Akash events participation. And yet cash community. For example the steering committee call.

Robert Del Rey: We added a feature videos playlist with some of the highest view count videos about a cash. And we also spoke about the possibility of adding feature from trusted community members inside the cash YouTube channel

Robert Del Rey: Lastly we also added the short section. We're going to talk about the YouTube shorts in a moment. at the moment, we don't have any shorts, but we do consider them as part of the content strategy that we are planning for a cash in the next coming months. So yeah, those were mainly the topics from last week. I want to stop for a brief second to hear if everybody has thoughts from last week, which they want to share now. Otherwise move on to the next topic. So I will give you a few seconds to think about the topics from last week.


### 00:05:00

Tyler Wright: Heads down with some other Sig design stuff and some console stuff. So I think you'll have some time to dedicate to the class YouTube channel later this week. in terms of I guess deliverables as we talk about last week, I would love to figure out to maybe we can get some additional support from somebody here, but I would love to start to maybe get

Tyler Wright: the steering committee meetings on the YouTube channel of the playlist just so we can start to tease alright, there's a lot of work that's starting to get done around the YouTube channel to look out for here's how to access the steering committee a little easier to decide just to GitHub and look out for, get If you want to get involved in helping out the YouTube channel, just like a call to action that we can do on the marketing front so I would love to start to see some of things. We talked about turning to deliverables and I just want to see if anybody here has any time or bandwidth. I know Robert's working on some things as well. But I'm excited to see what's going on this week in the short side and what elsewhere so

Robert Del Rey: Things where they had supplies, Go ahead. please.

oo o: Yeah, a Tyler. I think you asking if anybody's will help us in.

Tyler Wright: Sorry, yeah, I was on Yes. Yeah, I mean not really asking just talking about it. I know Robert has been leading this group. But again just like any of these six and working groups, anybody's open to participate, sometimes I participate as an overclock Labs member and we'll get some work done same with Dennis and others but if there's anybody else from the community that wants to participate whether it's just helping to write descriptions. Maybe it's a doc that didn't then it's copied over or helping, add specific steering committees, or we have a entire cost Community groups drive that's available to people in the community. And again just adding all the steering committee videos as an example with some content and maybe a link to the GitHub or a link to console whatever we agree upon us a group.

Tyler Wright: I think we can move into that phase a little bit while we're also ideating on some things. I think for me and Robert correct me from wrong, but the goal is really to have. A number of efforts going on at the same time as we look to continue to manage and grow the YouTube channel.

Robert Del Rey: Of course. Thank you so much We also have the cash YouTube working group open on Discord. So in case you don't have time to catch up the whole life. We can always resume the conversation and that these core Channel. Let me quickly ask you Tyler. I do have the link to the three Comedy Calls. so a few questions Would you like to upload all the files available there? I believe there are over 20 call recordings. Or if you prefer to have calls from a specific date until today. to be added

Tyler Wright: And I think I would love to add all of them, you…

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Tyler Wright: all of them historically with the same sort of naming convention. So Akash steering committee monthly meeting with the specific date, and then from there. We could figure out fine-tuning the descriptions or whatever, but I would love to at least start having them available there just as another reference point. They're always will live on are for whatever tool we end up using so that they have some web free home, but for easier access, I would like to make a playlist around them and then again kind of Market that playlist.

Robert Del Rey: All right, let's do that. And the other quick question is. Do you want any kind of editing going on to those videos or do you prefer just to have the whole full call uploaded as it is in the recording?

Tyler Wright: The only thing that I would want to do is potentially add an intro and an outro a short five seconds, branded a costume and then have a uniform thumbnail, but I don't want to spend too much time and energy editing those videos to be honest. I think there's could be better use of time and effort. But again,…


### 00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: it's quite a lot.

Tyler Wright: I would like to add if that's very easy. I would love to add a little short intro to each so that they at least look the same when you start, has the date the steering committee, maybe a General screen maybe who's on the steering committee? And then it just pops into the meeting from there?

Robert Del Rey: Great, German we got it.

Robert Del Rey: They can work on that this week.

Robert Del Rey: one second guys

Rodri R: No worries.

Robert Del Rey: Hey rodri evidence didn't see you. Thanks for coming in.

Robert Del Rey: So for next week, we should have the seating Community calls live into the community video playlist

Robert Del Rey: we have to pay special attention for an intro screen. with a brief overview of the call and then we can start out the description and other kinds of elements of the video. One thing that can be done is that the videos can be uploaded? And they can be uploaded as unlisted so that way they will be on YouTube but people won't be able to find them onto we're ready to publish so. That's something that can be done in the meantime.

Robert Del Rey: thank you so much today. let's go for the short samples.

Robert Del Rey: Let me open this up. Usually when I share my screen. people cannot hear the audio from my end. So let's do a little test. I will take over your screen sharing now if you don't mind.

Tyler Wright: Not at all.

Robert Del Rey: All right, we have infinity mirror over there. I will playlist. Let me know if you can hear this video.

Tyler Wright: I still see a number of infinity screen. you're playing it. No, I can't hear the audio. That's just me.

Rodri R: me neither

Robert Del Rey: Okay, okay. What?

oo o: they recognize

Robert Del Rey: I messed up sharing now.

Robert Del Rey: Never been able to sort this out. It's because of the headsets.

Robert Del Rey: mmm

Robert Del Rey: When you shared your screen tight, you don't have to press on any other setting you just share the screen and you share the audio as well or is that a separate option?

Tyler Wright: Sorry When I go to the share screen area and also says also share tab audio. And on the bottom that has a dongle that I can turn off and on.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, I can see it. Thank you so much, man. Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, it says to share audio share at that instead. Okay, so I need to share that.

Robert Del Rey: Wow, will this be possible? Let's see. Let me open up the period.

Robert Del Rey: So these are three shorts together in one single video.

Robert Del Rey: so that they have Some difference in a style also. The music for each is different which are with you. Hopefully you can hear it as well and through the share your feedbacks or let me know if this is something that you would like to have India cash Channel. We share. let's hear Eros here. You see the screen right? You see Greg and kubernetes. right


### 00:15:00

Tyler Wright: Yes.

Robert Del Rey: right Let me know if you can hear it. one second

Robert Del Rey: Can you hear it?

Rodri R: let me

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: Not me either.

oo o: Not me either.

Robert Del Rey: That's okay That's okay. I'm gonna be right back.

Robert Del Rey: We're gonna try again in a few seconds. Let's see.

Rodri R: If I'm not wrong, I think you're using OBS to share or just go Google here.

Robert Del Rey: I'm using just Google right now.

Rodri R: Okay, then now because when he started sharing your screen, we saw a mirror stuff. I thought you were using Obi. not sure at all.

Robert Del Rey: That was because of the Google meet. I'm trying something else right now. Let's see.

Robert Del Rey: We're gonna

Robert Del Rey: I'm just uploading in YouTube. It's gonna be unlisted so nobody will be able to see it. Maybe that way I can share that sound with you.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah. Yes. Wait, just one minute.

Robert Del Rey: 30 seconds left. All right. That's got the high speed internet.

Robert Del Rey: Do you remember the days when we used to have dialogue? And you need to disconnect if somebody was going to make a phone call in the house.

Robert Del Rey: We were all this.

Rodri R: Remember that yeah.

oo o: That's my current.

Robert Del Rey: These kids today.

oo o: That's correct my TV ringtone.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, today's have no idea and we had it before.

Robert Del Rey: All right.

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Robert Del Rey: I have to be there right now on YouTube. It's only listed so nobody else will be.

Robert Del Rey: Great, I believe this is gonna work. Thanks for bearing with me guys. I will share the screen again right now. and also share that how you

Robert Del Rey: let's go you see Greg, right?

Robert Del Rey: you will hear Greg hopefully, okay, so I think

Robert Del Rey's Presentation: look like again right after kubernetes found it kubernetes was launched in 2014. We were so fascinated by the technology. We wanted to make kubernetes a more production ready and fall tolerant and some of the origins things haven't changed the vision remain tag only the product and it came along quite a lot. We began the company in 2015 to make high performance Computing a possibility kubernetes had the foundational air and during the course of a development. We wrote quite a lot of code. In fact, there's a video here 2015 I talk to Akash the first black coaches written about nine years ago.

Robert Del Rey: that was the first one. Doing a few seconds. The other one is going to start. They compiled it together.

Robert Del Rey: I hope

Robert Del Rey's Presentation: But more for the library these reports and…

Robert Del Rey: okay Okay, here is it?

Robert Del Rey's Presentation: delete these reports.

Robert Del Rey's Presentation: But delete these reports in a network break our clothes that we wrote are deeply embedded in the kubernetes ecosystem at this point. I can see here as ranked number four for the libraries. We've written for a cash. I mean right in between Google and Mozilla and only human being on the list. I rank number 13 across the globe and the libraries are now used by funeral companies that you probably heard of these are the original Cash Source Code now, excuse me, Nvidia EMS, hash course, in fact media use, the cash libraries their Community drivers or network that uses kubernetes and Nvidia gpus effectively is a cautious source code.


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: That's the second one like that one. In the fair one. here is just

Robert Del Rey's Presentation: we found a coach originally when we found Akash, we didn't go down there decentralized. In fact, it was very centralized but a challenge with some class control plan. Is this fall tolerance, So when you have large clusters talk to a single control plane the chances of the control pain breaking down or causing Deadlocks is a combination if we quickly realize that you cannot scale to any level of high performance using a centralized control plane. The only way to massively scale is go back to the roots how internet was founded a decentralized network where instead of a single control plane can have a decent last control plane. There's no dependency on a single one of you

Robert Del Rey: And there you go. That was it guys. So now it's the time any thoughts feedbacks. How do you feel about these shorts?

Robert Del Rey: Absolutely.

Robert Del Rey: This is the only listed link so people won't be able to find. the video on their own only with this link there will be able to see the videos just so

Robert Del Rey: And I share it private. So yeah.

Robert Del Rey: This one came from the first talk of the Akash accelerate. And yeah, it was really fun. I do agree with you that since shorts hard super shorts. maybe the best way to use these tool is by sharing these core values about a cash like this and presentation. As Craig was talking. And also a specific features the kubernetes stuff this one about the source code of a cash being used in all of these companies.

Robert Del Rey: I believe that is a good piece of information that people can quickly cash right after they watch a quick 30 second shorts. That's why I believe these are so powerful. The long-form video are key. Honestly. It's proven on YouTube people look for long form content. But shorts they also have this space and I believe we can combine those two elements and come up with something really really nice for a cashew. So yeah, any other feedback maybe there's subtitles were a little big or maybe the animation was a little faster looking at it today with fresh ice. I can see they are a bit faster animations. It might be hard to read but I can go back to the editing tool and make sure that looks better for next time.

Robert Del Rey: And also make sure the volume it's a little lower so we can hear Greg's. For editing I used to Adobe Premiere Pro. I've been using Adobe for almost two years now. I started with filmora. Being And then migrated to Adobe. I also use these AI tools that you hear lately.

Robert Del Rey: These tools you can just upload the video and they basically edit the short video for you. I'll use a bunch of those six or seven. But at the moment, I believe they are not ready to do the job. for example, I'm the kind of person that I have to sit down and do this the best that I can do it right for me. This is not only content. it's valuable content for their cash Community, but it's also part of my work. That's why I like to take my timing doing this when I use the AI for example, that's a famous One. Sounding a lot recently. There are very limited in a sense that once the video is edited. You have not many options to


### 00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: edit or to do a quick fix for example, usually these tools deliver the short and that is what you get. If that makes sense. So Premiere Pro has a built in vocal docking Fisher Boys. yes. I know about talking. I didn't use docking in this one. I just lower down the volume. But yeah, I believe talking might be more appropriate in this case just to give a little context talking basically if I'm talking la la when I've stopped talking the music automatically raise the volume and when I start talking again, the music automatically lowers the volume. That's the docking feature in Premiere. I don't want b s I will try it out for the outcome short.

Robert Del Rey: Any other comments guys love all I did have a comment. I used to do shorts for two other companies one was blockstream. It's a big Bitcoin custodial. And the other one was Django exchange, you might not heard from her cosmos videos. and in the end of the short videos, we would add a closing screen with their so let's say Greg was talking la la and guard In the short answer it would transition to a closing screen. Let's say in a cash logo. The music volume goes up and that is a good closing for the shorts videos. That way they just don't stop so abruptly at the end.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, I like the touch of that. So that is something to consider. Maybe once we have the graphic assets we can play around more with that and try out if we want to have maybe the long form videos can have an intro and outro card and maybe the shorts can have an outro card. Just to make sure people. live with their cash run in their minds as soon as they finish watching our content. yeah. That's what I have for today. Honestly. I was so eager to show you this. I'm really happy that you like the initial idea. This is far from the final product.

Robert Del Rey: That's why I like to Rocked round and once I get the feedback, then I sit down and fine-tune the shore to make sure it looks as Christina as possible. You will need to forgive me on the quality on the videos because two things this is an horizontal video. So when reframing to make sure it's portrait. It degrades the quality alegro. That's once. if I zoom in the video For example, great I needed to zoom in his talking window. I need to somebody. because of that you can lose a little bit of quality as well. So that is something to consider. For future shorts the quality.

Robert Del Rey: Something that can be done as I work around. Maybe it's playing around with the movements. I don't know if you notice in the third shorts request was talking like this is our beginning. And the screen transition from him to the roadmap that they wrote a while back.

Robert Del Rey: We could do more animations of that maybe to hide a little bit the quality of the videos, but other overall, they look good. They are readable. But yeah something to consider they're not going to look like super pristine because of the process behind of refraining and reframing and framing. people in the show So yeah, that's any candidates about these you have any questions guys or anything else you want to bring to the table?


### 00:30:00

Tyler Wright: The only thing that I would add if I hand it back to Robert is I've noticed so I would ask the people do this when there is conversation that is happening in Discord channels. I noticed this with Sig documentation Nate or others will leave comments and talk about the work that they've done in the Discord Channel. It gets other people that are just looking around to get more involved. So while I appreciate people dming each other and dming I think that's fine for specific things. I would love for people to start to talk to each other more in public channels because I think that gets other community members excited and activated. So just putting that out.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks Simon. Yeah, I agree. Absolutely. The public way is the best way and like you say you put it perfectly usually people are just lurking around through the servers but they join a shot and they can see a sequence of messages and they can get a feel about how this channel is working or how the channel is going and that can motivate them to get involved. where you find a channel that is empty that is that silent. You can have to be opposite effect. That's the fastest way to get a people out of the community when they close to a few channels and they don't find any activity in the shots. It doesn't matter how look the GitHub looks or how many private messages we have.

Robert Del Rey: If you go to a public Channel and this channel is silent. Yeah, the effect is gonna be something like This project is that I'm gonna get out of here and they will go ahead and find the next thing. So I really thought you were saying is along those lines die, right?

Robert Del Rey: But yeah keep the conversation that's how we like it. Thank you so much. So yeah, so for next week, I just a little recap I will.

Robert Del Rey: Dennis is working in other kinds of stuff. I will try to follow up with him to maybe get at least A sample nothing official but something to work on. and for next week I can have It's gonna depend on my internet, but I'm really confident that next week. I can have all the steering Community calls uploaded in the playlist.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, From shorts I will go ahead and use your feedbacks. I will fix these three improve the sound improve the quality of the subtitles and the animations maybe try to use more icons that helps to keep the lowest attention span and I will divide them right and Export them as individual videos just of the sakes perhap them ready in case you want to publish them soon another day. But yeah, those are the two things I will work on for this freaking deliver on the next working group call which is gonna happen next Tuesday. If I'm not mistake next to stay the 20th. Wow. I guess it's flying in my opinion.

Robert Del Rey: But that's what I have for today guys. Thank you for the recording. and if anybody have any other questions feedbacks, feel free to drop them now in the next few seconds. Otherwise the cash YouTube channel. It's always okay 24/7. So feel free to go there and share your ideas. Thank you again b s Oakley rodri for taking the time to going these calls and yeah, let's do this guys. Let's do this. you see you in the miraburs. See you in the servers.

oo o: live long and prosper


### 00:35:00

Robert Del Rey: Live long and…

Rodri R: specifically

Robert Del Rey: All right.
