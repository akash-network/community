## Meeting Notes

- **Progress from Last Week**:
  - Robert Del Rey has not yet uploaded the steering committee calls to YouTube as the graphic assets, including opening and closing screens, are still pending.
  - YouTube does not allow post-upload edits for intro/outro screens, so the assets need to be finalized before uploading.
  - Robert may take the lead in creating these assets if needed.

- **YouTube Shorts Presentation**:
  - Robert shared the final versions of three YouTube shorts, which are now ready for publishing. The feedback from the previous meeting was implemented, and the shorts have been improved in quality and presentation.
  - The shorts are currently unlisted on YouTube, available only to those with the link.
  - Robert shared one short during the meeting for feedback and confirmed that the other two will be uploaded soon.

- **Comments on the YouTube Channel**:
  - Robert noted that while comments on the YouTube channel are minimal (one to two per week), questions about becoming a provider on the Akash Network are common.
  - A discussion followed about how to best respond to these comments. Rodri suggested keeping responses short and guiding people to the Akash Discord, where they can ask more detailed questions.
  - Rodri also mentioned the existence of an earnings calculator for providers, which could be useful in responding to these questions.

- **Phase Two of YouTube Updates**:
  - Phase two of the YouTube channel revamp is set to begin in September, which will involve more frequent content uploads and community engagement.
  - During this phase, the team will focus on repurposing and re-uploading videos, sharing content across platforms, and promoting it on Twitter and other social media.
  - Robert encouraged everyone to be prepared for the increased activity during phase two.

- **Future Call Frequency**:
  - The frequency of the SIG calls will change from weekly to biweekly moving forward, as the current phase is focused on assessing the channel and preparing for more active content creation.
  - Robert suggested that the call frequency may increase again once phase two begins in September.

- **Omniflix TV**:
  - Robert introduced the idea of using Omniflix TV, a platform in the Cosmos ecosystem, as an additional venue for posting Akash videos. It offers engagement features like tips and community interaction.
  - He is considering uploading Akash videos to Omniflix TV alongside YouTube, as it wouldn’t require much additional effort.

## Action Items
- **Robert Del Rey**:
  - Follow up with Dennis on the graphic assets for the steering committee call videos. If no progress, create the assets personally.
  - Upload the finalized YouTube shorts once ready.
  - Attend the design working group meeting to discuss branding and graphic assets.
  - Once assets are available, upload steering committee call recordings with intro/outro screens and uniform thumbnails.

- **General**:
  - Continue keeping YouTube comment responses short and direct users to the Akash Discord for more detailed discussions.
  - Prepare for phase two of the YouTube channel update starting in September, with more active content uploads and social media promotion.

# **Transcript**

Robert Del Rey: All right everybody. Thank you so much for joining these I cast YouTube working group on this call We discuss all things about a cash YouTube at the moment. The plan is to revamp the channel make it look better make it attract more people. And overall overall revamping their Cash YouTube channel and improves their content quality. So yeah.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you for joining. So guys I don't have many topics for today as you can see Tyler's not joining Dennis. It's not joining either. We're still trying to figure out. the best time for this call So bear with us for a second.

Robert Del Rey: yeah last week.

Robert Del Rey: What did we do last week? Let me open up my agenda?

Robert Del Rey: awesome All that's quick. I remember I show you some shorts that are gonna be available in the cash due to page. we had two items to follow up on this week. One of them was uploading the sitting comedy course YouTube. I gotta say I haven't uploaded them yet. Because I still don't have the graphics to upload them. so basically instead of just uploading the calls as they are. We want to edit the calls a little to Opening screen and add a closiness screen So until I get that I won't be able to upload. the video

Robert Del Rey: Is it the tireless screen that we still needed when you say that Tyler's screen is youre Or you're referring to an intro S3 in the actual video.

Robert Del Rey: that little intro that Tyler talked about I still haven't got those assets so.

Robert Del Rey: I thought I could upload the videos to YouTube and then edit the videos. But that is not possible in YouTube. If we want to add something like that to the video, it has to be added before we upload you. So that's why I have an uploaded because I don't have the assets as soon as I get the assets. I will upload them. I believe I will end up doing them myself maybe who knows? But yeah, that. I can tell you though that the three YouTube shorts are ready for publishing after getting your feedback guys. This short look way better now, and I'm ready for posting. Let me go ahead and share my screen weekly with you so you can see it as well.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, this should be the ones. boasts one second guys

Robert Del Rey: second

Robert Del Rey: I had a pride.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, I will share my screen. Okay. Okay. What's your message?

Robert Del Rey: Let me know if you can see it guys.

Robert Del Rey: You said? Okay. Hey don't play with my man. you didn't see in the car.

Robert Del Rey: on the environment another day alive All So let me show you guys I uploaded the three shorts. They are unlisted at the moment. So. Nobody can see them only people with the link. And yeah, let's see this one. The quality is a little bit better. also presentation


### 00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: I believe that so yeah guys that is one of the best shorts at the moment. I would only show you this one. The other two were fixed Which upload them soon?

Robert Del Rey: But yeah, that's the thing. I want to share with you. Like I said, this call is going to be a little short today. There are some conflicting calls which are affecting the attendance, but That is one that those are the topics from last week the graphic assets, which we don't have yet in the YouTube short spinal versions.

Robert Del Rey: Besides that another topic that I wanted to bring to the table. It's about comments and replies on the YouTube channel at the moment. We're not getting that many comments, but still we get one or two comments a week.

Robert Del Rey: at the moment. Nobody's responding them. So let me show you one question.

Robert Del Rey: That there is at the moment. for example Let me just share the screen again.

Robert Del Rey: I'd say we'll just share this thing again. It's easier to explain that way. And you see the screen guys?

Robert Del Rey: I see a thumbs Thanks, Rodney. So at the moment, for example, we got this month. We got these two comments. These one is three weeks ago. It says this video needs to be remade. I watched the video and I thought I agree the video looks a little blurry. And it's very hard to follow the instructions. So I do agree with this guy that the video will be uploaded again. Now the comment that I want to grieve to bring to your attention is usually most of the comments are related to this can I use a regular computer with a 360 and put it on the Akash Network? Usually most of the questions are in this line. how can I provide on a cash? What computer do I need to provide on my cash things like that?

Robert Del Rey: So what I wanted to ask you a specifically rodri, I wanted to get your input on this. How do you believe it's the best way to respond to this questions because the answer can get too big in my opinion? For example, there are many angles that you can answer this question. For example. You can ask the guy if if they want to make money in a question Network. And you're gonna provide with just a regular laptop. It's gonna be harder for you because you're gonna be against people with the big equipments you see

Robert Del Rey: But if you want to just send out a cash and just know the flow of it and how you use it. It's certainly fine. If you connect a regular computer, we have 30 60. Am I early? Am I getting it right? So what I wanted to confirm is how it should respond, Should we give the answer short? and guide people to other places in the community or should we respond with a big text giving them all the possible details that they might. and the third question Who should answer this comments in their Cash YouTube channel? So I'll leave it up to you in case you want to share something. If not, that's totally fine.

Rodri R: I'm an opinion and keeping a short would be better. especially if you put a text and on the video then maybe gonna take a while to read what they're gonna have to posit or something. Maybe point someone to the Discord. But maybe mostly short answers I think would be better. And what he said, it's right. I mean if you want to earn akt and to become a provider. If you just have your normal computer laptop. It's gonna be hard to compete with the larger providers. Although they could do some kind of maybe mining or other stuff that could earn them to make by deploying akt by a normal laptop or


### 00:10:00

Rodri R: earning a kitty would be earning something else, but you would be deploying on a cash. Yeah, it's kind of hard to keep it short because like you said there's many ways that can be done.

Robert Del Rey: alternative with you, man That maybe we should route them to. other places like this or in there they can chat and ask all the questions that they want And this score we'll have to recognize that this or a cash Discord is one of the most helpful and responsive discourse in the crypto Market in my opinion. So against that yeah, like you say rodri's will keep the answer shorts and Route people to Discord. it's gonna give us a great result in my opinion. as if there is a calculators to let people estimate their earnings. I don't know if there is a calculator for that. Maybe rodri can share some like yeah.

Rodri R: Yeah, there's a calculator in prayer app. I think it's now in the console as well. Yeah, there's a culture. I don't have the link right now, but there is one.

Robert Del Rey: more than moving Thank you. Rodri. Okay, okay.

Robert Del Rey: You need one second guys and high Tyler.

Rodri R: I'll share the link to calculator later, but I'm at a Burger King right now taking care of the child in the playground.

Robert Del Rey: And that's looking fine. Thanks for sharing.

Robert Del Rey: I wouldn't mind having a burger right now, honestly. although it's

Rodri R: I agree one now playing.

Robert Del Rey: Okay guys, so just a little recap. God. Okay. What was it?

Robert Del Rey: can you say that again rodried? What kind of content you're referring to right now?

Robert Del Rey: thank you so much at the moment. Were not uploading anything.

Robert Del Rey: in this time, we're just assessing the channels what we can do. Right now we're focused on the formatting of the videos. We are focused on the titles what they say. We're focus on the descriptions on the videos what they will say and around September we're gonna start phase two and during phase two we're gonna be more active with content. So I believe that that's the time where you can contribute way more because we're gonna repurpose the video. We're gonna pre upload them. And we also going to share in Twitter and other areas. So yeah, this is gonna be a big game for guys. So yeah be ready because when we start we're really gonna start if that makes sense.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, I was gonna do a little recap for the people joining later. Basically we cover.

Robert Del Rey: The last week items Facebook about the graphic assets. We will include in the videos to be of love with it. I just clarify that when you upload a video to YouTube. There are some minor things that you can edit. but you cannot do a big editing For example, if I upload a video and I decided I want to add a new Opening screen or a new closet screen. I won't be able to do that. I will need to delete the video and edit the video and we upload again. So just guys to be aware about that.


### 00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: so one of the shorts that we're doing to highlight those sites of information in the info regarding the page. At the moment I did three shorts with one of the correct thoughts. And yeah, you saw the final version. It's later on YouTube. It hasn't been uploaded yet. But And we spoke about how we will handle the comments and responses. I totally agree with you.

Robert Del Rey: guys Sorry, I just got a message. Iteran agreed with you guys rodri. We should keep the answers short and and Route people Are shots in the shots, they will have more chances to ask more broader questions. I guess go ahead project.

Robert Del Rey: totally alrighty

Robert Del Rey: so those are all the topics that I had for today. I'm just gonna open it up. To that you in a session in case you guys have questions or ideas now, it's a good time to share them. But before that, let me advise you guys the frequency of these call. It's gonna be change.

Robert Del Rey: As I was saying Oakley, at the moment we're just reviewing the channel assessing the things that we would do. However, we're going to be way more active in the phase two for September or around that day. So the frequency of this call is gonna be changed at the moment instead of being weekly as we were doing it. It's gonna be By weekly now, it's gonna be every other week Guess one week. No. Or every two weeks after it in all the ways that you can say it I guess so, yeah.

Robert Del Rey: Maybe after this month or maybe when we start the next phase and we need to give more updates. Maybe we can increase the frequency. Maybe we leave it that way. Who knows? But yeah at the moment the frequency of this call is going to be changed to apply weekly. That is one note that I have to share with you now. Yeah, we can answer to the Q&A session. So let me know guys anything else you want to touch about the attached YouTube channel

Robert Del Rey: All right. If there is not that thoroughly fine.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, yeah. another thing that I have in the back of my head, but I haven't would much effort into it is only flicks TV, on Netflix is an old partner of a cash and somewhat big in the cosmos ecosystem. They have business streaming platform. And projects can upload their videos and there is no a cash presence in that platform. So something I'm really considering. is that we should at least use it as an extra platform to post a cash on and if we publish a video on a cash YouTube, I don't see why not. We couldn't publish on Netflix TV as well.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, it's very engaging also people can give you tips. You can also convert your videos it gives you some other ways to engage with your community. So just dropping out the idea. It's not something like I'm serious seriously considering but something that It wouldn't require the X-ray for honestly, so that's why I'm sharing it And Yeah, the next working group called then it's gonna be on next month September the Third.


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: and yeah, we already guys in the meantime. We have the cash YouTube this course Channel. And feel free to drop your questions or comments in there, too. Now I could see a question in the shed. Do you have a link to their hash style sheet I can try to make the tireless screen on camera if you want. Thank you so much for approaching b s i can well.

Robert Del Rey: the guidelines I don't have the guidelines. We will need to talk with Dennis about that but I can send you the brand assets so you can get started doing some drop if you want to I have done some myself so I could share them with you so you can have an idea and I'm using the last designs as a guide. Let me give you a visual example. For example, I did one thumbnail and I got inspired by this. Brand design. These are for example if you see the last videos of a cache. the thumbnails I try to do I want to be in line with this. So maybe if you want to do something.

Robert Del Rey: It can be something similar to this and then you can share it in the cash Discord Channel in the next call and we go from there. or maybe we could take this to the design working group called tomorrow. I don't know. It's your choice. I'll be there tomorrow as well. So. Yeah. that could be a good place to get a started.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks for stepping up All So guys anything else you want to touch on before we leave these two experience?

Robert Del Rey: If not, that's I will tell you my promises for the next two weeks. I will join the design working group called tomorrow to follow up on these designs. As soon as I have the designs. I will go ahead then and upload the steering Community calls the YouTube channel. A Tyler. Let me ask you my man, and you don't have to jump in if you don't want to maybe you can write the message. But besides the steering committee calls are there other call recordings you would like to upload Cash YouTube.

Tyler Wright: I think that's a group decision. Eventually. I've thought about maybe all of them but I feel like that might get too cluttered. Maybe we just start with the steering committee and then we can make sure that it links to the community repo and go from there. But if anybody here thinks that we should be adding other more specific cigs, like sick providers get a lot of traction a lot of those things get a lot of traction so we could talk about it here for But steering committee. I thought was a great starting point because it's like a culmination of everything that goes on.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks Tyler, and I Agree, we can. Start with that one and go from there. So yeah, let's do that.

Robert Del Rey: All right, guys, let's talk into weeks the recording for this should be available soon. In the comments for these calls should be on Discord as well. I'm inviting you again to get involved in the conversation in their Cash YouTube. And again my DMs are open and see you sing in two weeks guys if not sooner. with that being said have a nice weekend and see you in the mirrors. All right.

Robert Del Rey: my pleasure by

oo o: You give them?
