## Meeting Notes

- **Progress from Last Week**:
  - Robert Del Rey has not yet uploaded the steering committee calls to YouTube as the graphic assets, including opening and closing screens, are still pending.
  - YouTube does not allow post-upload edits for intro/outro screens, so the assets need to be finalized before uploading.
  - Robert may take the lead in creating these assets if needed.

- **YouTube Shorts Presentation**:
  - Robert shared the final versions of three YouTube shorts, which are now ready for publishing. The feedback from the previous meeting was implemented, and the shorts have been improved in quality and presentation.
  - The shorts are currently unlisted on YouTube, available only to those with the link.
  - Robert shared one short during the meeting for feedback and confirmed that the other two will be uploaded soon.

- **Comments on the YouTube Channel**:
  - Robert noted that while comments on the YouTube channel are minimal (one to two per week), questions about becoming a provider on the Akash Network are common.
  - A discussion followed about how to best respond to these comments. Rodri suggested keeping responses short and guiding people to the Akash Discord, where they can ask more detailed questions.
  - Rodri also mentioned the existence of an earnings calculator for providers, which could be useful in responding to these questions.

- **Phase Two of YouTube Updates**:
  - Phase two of the YouTube channel revamp is set to begin in September, which will involve more frequent content uploads and community engagement.
  - During this phase, the team will focus on repurposing and re-uploading videos, sharing content across platforms, and promoting it on Twitter and other social media.
  - Robert encouraged everyone to be prepared for the increased activity during phase two.

- **Future Call Frequency**:
  - The frequency of the SIG calls will change from weekly to biweekly moving forward, as the current phase is focused on assessing the channel and preparing for more active content creation.
  - Robert suggested that the call frequency may increase again once phase two begins in September.

- **Omniflix TV**:
  - Robert introduced the idea of using Omniflix TV, a platform in the Cosmos ecosystem, as an additional venue for posting Akash videos. It offers engagement features like tips and community interaction.
  - He is considering uploading Akash videos to Omniflix TV alongside YouTube, as it wouldn’t require much additional effort.

## Action Items
- **Robert Del Rey**:
  - Follow up with Dennis on the graphic assets for the steering committee call videos. If no progress, create the assets personally.
  - Upload the finalized YouTube shorts once ready.
  - Attend the design working group meeting to discuss branding and graphic assets.
  - Once assets are available, upload steering committee call recordings with intro/outro screens and uniform thumbnails.

- **General**:
  - Continue keeping YouTube comment responses short and direct users to the Akash Discord for more detailed discussions.
  - Prepare for phase two of the YouTube channel update starting in September, with more active content uploads and social media promotion.
