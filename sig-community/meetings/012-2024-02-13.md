Adam Wozney: All right. I think we live. Thank you guys for joining today's Community Sig call on what days today the 13th of February the day before Valentine's Day. So hopefully everyone has plans for their significant others, and if you don't have significant others, hopefully have plans to maybe find one or if you don't want one. it's really up to you.

Adam Wozney: But today we're going to be chatting about all things community and the Akash Network just as a reminder of folks that have joined these calls are just to let people know who never seen these or maybe watching. The recording the Sig Community calls are really focused on discussion support topics and managing kind of cost Community initiatives. Those Community initiatives can run from events to the hackathons that we're doing education programs or even programs that you guys are individually working on zeli for example So that's really what the focus of these calls are before I get into my agenda to cover some items. I wanted to see if there is any agenda items that you guys wanted to cover or include in the conversation.

Adam Wozney: Go ahead Robert.

Adam Wozney: Cool, and y'all add that to maybe the very back end of my agenda just maybe a quick update from you see what thoughts you have or you and Benjamin? I know you guys are kind of working closely on that. So yeah, I'll include that for you guys at the end here any other agenda items or things you'd like to discuss or revolving around kind of Akash community activities.

Adam Wozney: All right, so the handful things to cover I'm gonna go over some of the upcoming events that we have in person. That's all approved through the governance proposal that passed a few a month or so ago. We're gonna talk about our hackathon which as a working group formed around upcoming hackathon. That will be hosting. I'll give a very brief update on Akash edu, which is something we launched about two weeks ago. And then I'll talk about some of the bounties that are available on the bounty board also been Scott could join because I know him and Ty have been kind of leading that but I can cover that at a high level and then I'll pass it over to Robert in Benjamin to see if they want to give any kind of developer onboarding updates in terms of the zeely project that they're working on and then if there are any other items that you guys think about or want to feel free to let me know and we'll include it in.

Adam Wozney: Gender these are meant to be informal. So as I'm talking through your hand up. You have a question or thoughts or feedback and we want to include you guys in the conversation. But first I want to talk about events for me personally. It's been taking up a lot of my time. Especially East Denver which is coming up in a little under two weeks. I believe Akash is gonna have a gigantic presence there, which is pretty cool. I've attended many members the past before joining, the Akash community and from my previous kind of

Adam Wozney: events that I've hosted or participated within the Akash ecosystem. This one is maybe probably four x bigger, which is really cool. And I think that's just because a lot of excitement about what is going on and within the ecosystem. So we're gonna be having Greg co-founder of Akash, he's gonna be on several panels throughout the side events and on stage at Denver itself. I'll be moderating or I'll be em, seeing the Adam Denver event, which is something that we kind of spearheaded initially Adam Denver was gonna be we'll bring in a couple folks from different Cosmos projects to do small Meetup the last couple hours and it's turned to turn into nine different projects that are spot kind of helping support through sponsorship. I'm series of panel events. It's not going to be just about Kosh but we're gonna have a big representation there with

Adam Wozney: Myself moderating Greg will be on a panel to be a series of. Panels and speaking opportunities throughout the day and there will be a little networking break some fun video game activities, which you can kind of participate in and then the after-party which is just networking and grabbing light bites and some drinks so that can be a bit one of the big events. We're also sponsoring Dora hack their app chain day, which I believe is on the 27th. We're gonna have a booth there, which I actually just found out yesterday. I thought we were sponsoring it would have some banners up but we are gonna have a booth there. So I think I'm gonna kind of lure in some of the Insiders and some overclock folks to help support the booth that we have. We want to be there all day. It's kind of on and off so we can kind of go in and hang out every now and again,

Adam Wozney: I think those are the big things a lots of activities happening for eat Denver really really excited about that. If anyone that's watching this call or watching the recording is gonna be adding them or able to send me a DM or message in the general chat and just tag me and I would love to get you included in some of the Akash activities that we're doing whether it's helping out at the booth that we have at Denver helping out the boot that we have now at door hacks for their Train Day or getting involved in Adam Denver. Those are the big three events that will be doing and then of course. We'll probably be doing a tweet or a message soon about all the different activities Greg will be speaking yet because he has seven different events. He's talking about which is kind of wild. So I hope he's a tea with them because Voice make it straight by the end of the event. So I think that we're the next two big events that are happening. This quarter are Kubecon's gonna be happening in Paris. It's the first kind of web to we kind of event akash's sponsored and participated in

00:05:00

Adam Wozney: As a part of our sponsorship, we actually have a few additional tickets those tickets are about 1500 dollars, I believe and we're looking for folks that are interested in attending kubecon. We won't be able to fly them out or fly folks out from the community, but if people can get to Paris if they can, cover their own costs to get there. We will be able to give them a free ticket and in return we're hoping that they can help out at a boost that we have. We're good on coverage. We don't need any additional support at the booth, but I think having a few extra hands on deck is always beneficial. So if you want to free ticket to kubecon which cost quite a bit and you're gonna be in Paris send me a DM I put a message in the coupon Channel inside of the caution Discord if you have any questions in there throw it in there.

Adam Wozney: And then finally Nvidia which is happening over the same time period actually as kubecon we're gonna have one of our insiders. It's actually on this call participating in that we're going to be doing a cocktail party with a partner. We're having a small very private VIP dinner with the cash folks and maybe some VIPs and then we're also sponsoring of Booth with a partner at Nvidia, which is cool. And this is another web toy kind of event because

Adam Wozney: Videos so big and Ai and gpus now it just made sense for a cost to be there. So we'll see what comes out of it, but I'm really excited for those three events. Last event thing I'll mention is we have already approved an event happening in Q2 consensus, which is happening in Austin. It's kind of the oldest in the crypto space. It's just a giant event that happens over the course of four or five days in Austin. We are going to be doing a booth there or sorry not Booth but I'm Meetup. That'll be on site at consensus. So won't be a side event. It's actually part of the consensus programming and it's because we got in so early we're gonna be the only kind of individual Meetup that's gonna be focused on AI that happens throughout consensus, which I think will bring a lot of attention to Akash, which is really cool. And there's also some talk of some other big event.

Adam Wozney: are thinking about hosting and lead up to consensus which more details on that to come in the future, but I want to plan seeds of some Alpha for you guys to kind of get excited about So those are the big person events activities that are happening and over the next two or three weeks here. If you have any questions about that, you can head into the Discord channels. There's three temporary Discord channels for each of those events that I mentioned that you can ask your questions or get more involved in or just kind of see what's going on besides those person events. Are there any upcoming events that you guys are participating in are interested in kind of getting involved in any kind of person events that you guys are thinking about that happen this quarter or throughout the rest of the year. Any questions or thoughts on that?

Adam Wozney: All right, cool. Next thing is the hackathon. So our governance proposal passed about a month or so ago and we just did our first proper kickoff call with the hackathon working group this week right now. We're tentatively scheduling our first hackathon of the year for April 1st kickoff. So that's in about, a little under two months. The two big things that were working on is I put it in an application for community members that are interested in helping out with the hackathon a paid opportunity similar to what we did for our last hackathon last fall. Basically, we're looking for a community manager someone who's able to for one or two hours throughout the course of week respond to questions in regards to the

Adam Wozney: Done inside of our Discord and on the door hacks website, which is where our hackathon will be located. We're looking for an events Someone who can help put together and manage workshops and activities and a kickoff call and end of show call for the hackathon which will last, over the course of what a month and a half or so.

00:10:00

Adam Wozney: And then we're looking for a marketing manager and really that focus is gonna be on finding potential sponsored tracks so we can partner with other projects that have a Synergy between the Akash Network and what they're building just sponsor a track and then encourage their Community to get involved in our act upon as well. As this part of this role is gonna be finding judges folks who will be able to dedicate their time to revealing all the applications and the projects that come in drafting feedback for those projects and then also contributing to the end of the hackathon call where we announce winners and then judges and kind of share their thoughts on the hackathon overall. So three big roles, those are paid opportunities. If you have any questions about the hackathon joined working group Channel inside of the Akash Discord and we'll get you guys involved in that. So any questions in regards to the hackathon.

Adam Wozney: All We're Trucking right along. next up is Akashi to you. So we launched Akash edu last about two weeks ago. I think right now we've had a little over 300 people who've actually registered and gone through each of the different curriculum projects, which is pretty cool. I am starting to think about adding new curriculum to the courses because while we have this interest I want to kind of keep the care and stick model going where there's new courses people coming back and trying to update their education on all these different things.

Adam Wozney: so I'm working with one of our Akash insiders to potentially put together a provider course and then there's a couple other folks from the community that are interested in creating videos in regards to Akashi to you. So there is anyone interested in creating courses for Kashi to you send me a DM or jump into the Akashi to you Channel, which I believe we've relaunched inside of our Discord. And any questions on Akashi to you right now.

Adam Wozney: All one last thing you'll actually mention what it cost you since this is really the second wave of us kind of putting a proper kind of encouraging people to take these courses. We did the first push about four or five months ago, which is one course and now we added three more. I'm planning

Adam Wozney: On what was I going with this? this is it so the long term Vision just for folks that are maybe curious because I've seen some governance proposals go up and the Discord chat in Discord discussions about educational programs. The long term vision of Akashi to you is to create enough curriculum that will give people a full-fledged understanding from a technical vantage point and from a non-technical advantage point of the Kash Network essentially at a certain point. I want people to become certified and that's something that we can share with folks. They can put on their LinkedIn they can use it to find jobs. They can use it to kind of launch their own projects and then we can also find projects that potentially support through governance proposals through the Adu program. I see a lot of different opportunity for Akashi to you but it is still early. So keep your fingers across tight that everything kind of progresses nicely. But so far, we're off to a good start on Akashi

Adam Wozney: cool Next up is bounties. So for folks that are unfamiliar. We do have bounties that are launched inside of GitHub bounties board and kind of a regular Pace. Generally the bounties are focused on things that will help support or grow the Akash ecosystem. And they are paid opportunities to build these things.

Adam Wozney: So for anyone I'm just going to put it in the chat here as soon as I can get it open for anyone that's interested in getting involved in these opportunities. You can go to this link. That's the bonus board. And if you have any questions about the bounties that live right now, which there's two that are live one is building a doc container for starknet that can be deployed in And the other one is documentation for a hybrid processor provider all the details and what those mean. I don't even fully know what they mean all the details for what those things are requesting are inside the GitHub in that link there. You can put in your questions put in your thoughts a few folks from the overclock the side are responding and monitoring those questions. So feel free to jump into that chat anytime. Any questions on the bounties?

Adam Wozney: Cool go for Benjamin.

Benjamin B: I also wanted to say that they just checked on both of them. And one seems to be paid out. Excuse my voiceless and the other one seems to have someone working on it right now. So they don't look to be available right now.

00:15:00

Adam Wozney: It's funny before this call. I went in there and it looks like someone went in and just updated it. So always be tracking the bounty board because things are updating very quickly there. thank you for that call a Benjamin, but we're looking. There's no art and fast bounties that are every week. There'll be a new Bounty. It's kind of when they come up through Community conversations GitHub discussion special interest group calls through people's feedback. So they kind of pop up every now and again, but it does happen like Robert says they go fast. So if anyone is interested to kind of get involved in those bonus track that board that's probably the best place to go to kind of get the updates, but go ahead Benjamin.

Benjamin B: And without that I think it's probably possible to reach out directly in the working groups and in the special interest groups that you're interested in when something is discussed. So if something is needed you can say hey I'm able to do this if I get about

Adam Wozney: Absolutely. I would probably. Yeah, exactly. I think a lot of the bounties that kind of pop up are through conversations that are had in all the different working groups and special interest groups. So if you have an idea on something that you think would be beneficial to akash, you can jump into those specific groups those Community groups and sigs and working groups and kind of pitch them there and then from there there's a couple different ways and go but you can create a bounty around it or even if it's a bigger project you can go into GitHub discussions and create a potential governance proposal and a template for governance proposals are inside get up discussion. So good call out Benja other than that, those are really the big Community kind of activities that are taking place right now.

Adam Wozney: Any other thoughts or community activities you want to call out before we maybe hand it over to Robert and Benjamin on some celiate developer onboarding updates.

Adam Wozney: All right. Go ahead Andrew.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Yes, I just a quick question. So a previous time 2020. We used to participate in different hackathons just on tracks like consolana and the other blockchains. Do we still plan to do that just to get more Akash attention on that or

Adam Wozney: Yeah, so it's not anything that I'm personally working on. I'm in terms of my day to day and kind of agenda. It's pretty much locked in. I don't really have much bandwidth for anything else. However, I'm definitely Pro getting involved and external hackathons. I think if we did that we'd probably do the same thing that we do for a lot of these governance proposals put together proposal we see a hackathon coming up states with salana and it's in Three months I would say anything that's less than a month. That's probably not enough time to go through a proper governance proposal. But if you see something coming up, that's maybe two to three months out that's hackathon related and you're like, I think Akash could sponsor a track here. I think it's absolutely worth starting a conversation maybe in the community Sig or you're getting going to the hackathon working group because it's not because that's what we can kind of use that as a for all hackathon activities our own and external.

Adam Wozney: But put your thoughts in there and then if you see the beginning some positive traction over a few days, maybe throw together a government's proposal the hardest problem with that is we need someone to manage it and that's why I'm saying that I won't be able to kind of help out with that very much just because I have a lot of these activities that I mentioned to you. But if someone is willing to dedicate time including pay for themselves to manage this inside their governance proposals, I'm totally Pro the idea. I think we should try to get out to all possible developers that are interested in viding compute deploying on a decentralized network or getting involved with aigp or in the AI GPU world. I think any kind of activity that kind of links with that in terms of the hackathons that are happening external to our own. Yes. I'm super on board with it, but it probably be something I have to go through a governance proposal and starting in a discussion group through one of these working groups or special interest groups. That makes sense.

Adam Wozney: All right, cool. awesome

Adam Wozney: Cool, that's it for my updates. The last thing in the agenda was zealing developer onboarding. I know it's something Robert and Benjamin have working on for a while. The first pilot project kind of happened last year and I would say it was a success and so because of that we're looking to scale it up a bit and kind of do some new things. So yeah Robert Benjamin wanted to see if there's any updates. from zeely

00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: Hey guys, can you hear me? Alright?

Adam Wozney: Yep.

Robert Del Rey: I have unable that it seems like he bought a real recently and he just tested it out right now. So that's why I asked anyway guys. Yeah Thank you so much for the words, the developer on board the initiative that Benji and I are leading on Sealy. It's ready to take off this week. We had the silly working group called where we share the next mission. We're gonna have available For the next space of the silly program. I'm not gonna call it a pilot anymore. So yeah the city program. It's about to come in real real hard just to mention a few of the Nations that we're working on.

Robert Del Rey: I won't say anything. If you want to see the missions I go to the silly working group chat on a cash Discord in and go there. If you have any questions also, we have to discussion going on on GitHub. Please go over the proposal and leave your comments and thoughts. Something that I will say we have done some improvements to the missions initially. We were focused on Beginner developers, but now the focus. It's brother. in the sense that we want to bring system developers or so regular community members and also real good content creators and something we did for that is that we have

Robert Del Rey: different missions based on the type of quests that you want to do. Let's say you're only interested in the developing missions. If you do that mission, you will have access only for the developer missions. Let's say you just want to create content and you don't want to develop anything. That's also fine. You can do the initial first mission for that and have access only for the content creation mission. Which is amazing That will help us to classify. The participants better something that happened in the pilot is that we got many people participated, but we couldn't Classify them properly. So I guess this is going to help us out with that one Mission. I'm gonna say though.

Robert Del Rey: It's about content creation. And I believe is if we get a good winner for this one. You're gonna love it Adam and you're gonna add it in the cash key to you. Let me tell you the name of the mission. one second All right. I lost It's month to so yeah, we're gonna have permissions for one more months to a month three. This one is for month. Number two. and it's about create A documentary about the story of cloud computing and what is a cash role in the cloud computing Market?

Robert Del Rey: Benjamin I believe this topic it's amazing if we can get somebody to do a real 10 15 minute video about it. It's gonna be good information or all the people that watch the video and if they do that they might be able to earn some AKA out of it and who knows what comes next? So yeah, that is one mission that I can let you know again, if you want to see all the missions you can go to the GitHub discussion or you can go to that cache Steely channel on Discord. But yeah, that is what I wanted to say. I don't know when you have any extra go for it, man.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I wanted to have that. I linked the discussion page in the shot and we would really appreciate if you could read through it and comment a little because we are ready to create the proposal. and Robert shared some updates on Discord as a comment and I don't think we need to create another discussion page. But if you feel otherwise, please comment that and maybe we live and release the proposal this week.

Adam Wozney: very cool cool

Adam Wozney: so if you are interested folks listening in the call, if you are interested in kind of giving your feedback thoughts or maybe even potentially getting involved in supporting kind of Robert and Benjamin's momentum within zeely jump into the zealy working group inside of Discord, but especially going to GitHub discussions because that's where all the conversations are happening right now in terms of zeli and then next steps for that will be a proposal fingers crossed that it gets funding because I feel really positively about Seeley. I think it's a great kind of supportive project for all of our educational efforts at accomch so very big fan and thanks to Robert and Benjamin for all the work. They've been doing on really cool stuff. Any questions for Roberta Benjamin on the zeli activities.

00:25:00

Adam Wozney: No, okay, cool. that's really all we have for the call. I know Julius just joined. Sorry Julius but we wrapping things up today. We covered all the upcoming events East Denver kubecon and video and ways to get involved to kick off of the hackathon which is tenantly scheduled for April 1st, but if you're interested go and apply into hackathon working group Channel, there's a link in there to apply to support it and get paid and rewarding for supporting that we talked about Akashi you and some new courses if you're interested in creating some courses for that send me a DM we talked about the current bounties that live looks like a lot of them have been kind of snatched up already. So definitely document that page and bookmark that get a bounties board page. And finally we talked about ceiling and all the efforts Robert and Benjamin working on return to zealy more wrap up our call any final thoughts questions concerns anything that's top of mind for you guys.

Adam Wozney: No last thing I'll actually mention is I finally have found I'm kind of caught up on all the events stuff that I've been working on. So I'm finally starting to go through the occasion cider applications and reviewing and reaching out. while I haven't really started going through them since the end of last year 2023. So we have about 60 or so applications that I've gone through and I'm started to reach out to some folks. So hopefully we'll have some new caution cider which for folks that are listening in their kind of the tip of the Akash Community sphere. hopefully we'll have some new insiders over the next few weeks here. So if you are interested in that head over to the brand new Akashi website, which looks beautiful by the way for anyone that's been helping out with the cash website and you can apply to become an Insider there.
