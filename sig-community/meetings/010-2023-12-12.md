Adam Wozney: right cool, and I think we Thank you guys for joining today's Community Sig office hours working call special interest group Community event. This is the final Community Sig call of the Year. This is the first year that we've kind of done this sig and working group kind of strategy and framework. So I think it's been pretty good so far and we're definitely getting towards the end of the year. I said before this call started.

Adam Wozney: We're about three weeks until 2024 and I've seen calls from different things that we're doing whether it's Twitter spaces or office hours with insiders or Sig calls getting less and getting more people are starting to check out for the new year. So I'm expecting a January 1st. All of the events to be super jam packed with people or standing remotely in these calls. So thank you guys for joining today's special interest group Community call just as a reminder just the level set the community Sig definition is really focused on discussing supporting and managing Akash Community initiatives those initiatives sometimes turn into working groups. Sometimes as initiatives are just one off things like bounties, but anything that you can think of in terms of what community members are doing to contribute to the network, this is kind of a good place to start for that.

Adam Wozney: I only have a handful of agenda items today some of these things you guys might be aware of some of them you might not but I thought it'd be good just to kind of cover our bases so that way once we hit the ground running. We'll be ready to hit the ground running next year for our first Community call of the new year. But before I get into my agenda items I have one for you Robert I mentioned before this call started, but is there any agenda items you guys would like to cover anything that you guys are thinking about or interested in discussing?

Adam Wozney: All right, yeah, so my gym is pretty straightforward. It's a lot of stuff that we've talked about in other calls. But first thing is events the governor's proposal for events have passed the signaling proposal. So I'm moving forward on the proposed events that were listed in the signaling proposal. Either before the end of the year or early next year. We're gonna put in our q1 budget request for events because the signaling proposal passed. I don't see any red flags or any issues with the three events that are listed in q1 that we're going to be participating in.

Adam Wozney: but I want to kind of quickly cover where things are at. I'm already starting to get the ball rolling out what our sponsorships and attendance looks like the first big one that's coming up in the new year is East Denver that's happening in February. We are sponsoring that we are gonna have a booth there. We are gonna bring on a few Akash community members in the Insiders program to help manage that booth at East Denver is the largest kind of aetherium developer conference in the United States. It's sister event ECC. The absent in Paris is the European version of East Denver. It's the largest etherium developer conference in Europe, but because it's such a big conference and because there's so many attendees and crypto fans there other projects get involved. So it's a huge event like 15,000 people attend. So we are going to be doing a booth we are gonna have caution insiders represent Akash at that Booth. I'm really excited for that. I should have more updates as time progresses, but

Adam Wozney: go to the events working group channel for more of the updates on East Denver. The next event that's coming up is NVIDIA GTC. We are not sponsoring that event. It was budgeted out that we could sponsor it but it is a huge event because of the AI boom and Nvidia kind of at the core of all AI talk really besides chat gbt. It's very expensive to participate sponsorship started way in July. And most of them has sold out.

Adam Wozney: Some of the higher tier sponsorships are $350,000 and that only gets you a very short amount of time to get on stage and talk it gets you a booth but then you got to spend money on putting this boot together. So you're looking at if you want to pull out presents and Nvidia. You're probably looking at 400 to 500 thousand dollars. We are not there yet. We are not gonna do that. I don't think they even offer food like it's not all they do but you try to pay for it. It's a very

Adam Wozney: high tier High Caliber event in a well-known space and a booming space. So instead of sponsoring we are going to be just attending. However, we are going to be doing kind of a private invite-only dinner. We're having a couple overclock members attend and I'm currently looking for some insiders that caution ciders to also represent Akash at the event. So probably three people in total go to Nvidia and that's gonna be just attending kind of getting a sense of what the conference is all about. Seeing how we can plug in a cost of maybe future conferences. so we'll see how that one goes. So we are first one we're attending so that one I'm working on. That's just attending so just paying for tickets no sponsorship. The next one that will be sponsoring is actually happening over the Nvidia time is kubecon in Europe.

00:05:00

Adam Wozney: Some of our insiders attended that one before I think it's very relevant to We're gonna be sponsoring a booth there. It's a little over what the sponsorship dollars that we have. But I do have some wiggle room to cover the sponsorship for that. So we should still fall under budget for kukan EU. Because we are going to be sponsoring a booth. I've already connected with three insiders and I think we have the three insiders that will represent Akash at kukan and help out with that Booth representation. The goal for that is really better understanding how we can get involved in future kubecon activities because they do a side events. They do a lot of different things throughout the course of the year in different parts of the world. So I think we're gonna get a lot of good understanding of what we can do in the future with them on top of just generating leads for introducing cost to people that might not be familiar with it in the traditionally a web to space like kubecon that's happening in Paris and that's gonna happen over the same period of time is NVIDIA. So we're gonna have a couple different kind of event groups going to those things.

Adam Wozney: And in the final event is consensus. That's the granddaddy of all crypto events been around the longest, 15 to 20,000 even more sometimes attend that event it's a week-long activity of all these different projects going there's investors and media and just all these different crypto projects that are going to be in tenants for consensus that's happening in Q2, but just to get the ball rolling assuming

Adam Wozney: That the Q2 events governance proposal will pass because historically all of them have passed I can kind of move forward on potentially getting a sponsorship going there what it looks like we'll be doing is bringing a couple insiders along to help and a couple overclock team members to help put together a media that will be on site during consensus. And the cool thing about it is there is now a big push into crypto and Ai because we're kind of at the Forefront of that we will have our own dedicated AI track that's essentially a part of this so there will be no other AI meetups. It'll be basically Akash AI Meetup at consensus. So we're gonna be kind of one of the diamonds for AI out there and I think we need a lot out of that Meetup opportunity and then it goes with all the other bells of whistles of that sponsorship. It is a little bit over what our proposed budget is for sponsorships alone. But again, I do have some wiggle room for our other activities that we'll be

Adam Wozney: In there, so I'm excited about the consensus event. That'll be happening in Q2 of this year. So still a lot to work out with that one, but we're putting that together. Last thing I was gonna mention before I move on from events or save you guys have questions about these for eat Denver. I'm also working on putting together a cosmos kind of either half day mini conference or potentially just a larger scale Meetup. I've connected with the folks Cosmo verse of connected with the folks at osmosis secret Network. Eve

Adam Wozney: what else is polygon Labs a few other Cosmos projects and the goal behind this kind of event that we're proposing is introducing East Denver participants to different Cosmos projects and getting some cosmonauts together to kind of network and meet each other and kind of shake hands and kiss babies as it were so a lot will be happening for Denver and videos gonna be pretty lightweight just attending Kube Carnival of a booth and then consensus is still kind of being worked out but usually consensus a lot going on, so they'll be a lot going on for consensus, but that's not for another four months or so.

Adam Wozney: that's it for in-person events that are part of the events working group because the last thing I was gonna say about that is if you want to get involved in all these event activities understand what we're doing how it's all working. Just go to the events working group Channel and our Discord and that's where all event activities in terms of us sponsoring or having a presence at owned events or not owned events. It's happening. Just go to that Discord Channel any questions on that before my quick next agenda item

Adam Wozney: All next up is Not tomorrow, but this Thursday, we're gonna be doing our first ever public Insider office hours. So for folks that are either watching this recording or current or new or OG insiders that are in the call right now traditionally office hours have been exclusive to The Insider Community. It's an opportunity for insiders to share feedback ask for support. We give Community updates and then sometimes we'll even bring in guests for kind of project updates on things that they're working on exclusive to The Insider Community. We are going to be doing our first ever public office hours this Thursday at 10 am

00:10:00

Adam Wozney: We're gonna be hosting it on Zoom. Usually we just do these inside our office hours on Google Hangouts because it's private but because we want people to see what goes on in these office hours and potentially find new insiders to apply to join the program. This is gonna be our first ever public one. That's really the goal of this is to kind of introduce the Insiders program to a wider scope of people and see if we can get some new applications if it's successful. We'll do some more in the future. We might not host it on Zoom. I've heard there's privacy issues of Zoom. So I definitely want to be well understanding of that, but we just wanted to get one up really quickly. so that'll be happening this Thursday if it's successful and people really respond. maybe we'll do some more in the future. If not, we'll just kind of keep doing these

Adam Wozney: Exclusively every week at Thursday at 10 am but that's gonna be happening. This Thursday live stream was just promoted on Twitter and go check that out. Feel free to promote that to your friends and colleagues, but that'll be happening this Thursday. that's it really for event related things any questions on any event related stuff before I move on to the next item here. See if there's anything in the chat. Nope. Yeah, cool.

Adam Wozney: Next up is the hackathon working group. So the hackathon working group was kind of formed out of the community special interest group a smaller subset of individuals so they wanted to get involved in actually putting you on in a cash hackathon. So we ran our first one last year. There was some things that went really really well. There was something that didn't go. the first hackathon was really focused on just kind of understanding what we want to do in upcoming hackathons. what doesn't work just generally figuring out what we want to kind of contribute in terms of folks that would be interested in building on top of Akash.

Adam Wozney: The hackathon working group was formed again for 2024 and currently the proposal is up on GitHub discussions for review it basically lists out three potential hackathons or three proposed hackathons for next year TBD and what we want people to build TBD and exact times but the general formula and the framework is now on GitHub disc. Questions for people's feedback. It's going to be open until next week Friday at that point. If there's any things that we want to change we'll change it. And from there. We'll put it up for a community governance vote on funding three hackathons for next year.

Adam Wozney: We will be looking for three roles as a part of the hackathon. It'll be a marketing manager role there will be and that basically their function is confirming judges for The hackathon and then additionally finding sponsored tracks other Cosmos or other projects that are interested in participating in the hackathon and having their own sponsored Bounty track something that links to Akash with their own prize pool. That's something that worked pretty well for our last hackathon. So the marketing manager will be doing the community manager role will be basically answering questions and set up private or not private but a public Discord channel for the upcoming hackathons. So just basically Community Support there answering questions about the hackathon and then the event manager role will be helping organize workshops with members of the overclock lab team member of the Insiders community and members of the sponsored tracks basically answering and putting

Adam Wozney: workshops on how developers can interact with their different protocols So those will be the three roles and those are paid roles. That's all listed in the hackathon working group are all in the hackathon GitHub discussion that's open right now. So go review that leave your feedback and then hopefully before the end of the year or early next year, we'll put it up for a governance vote to fund three hackathons for next year.

Adam Wozney: Next up is the community support prop. So that is another proposal governance proposal to fund community activities and there's really two big kind of items on the community support prop. That is up for GitHub discussions. Right. Now. The first is funding the vanguards program, which is kind of our Elite community members who respond to Discord Community questions answer technical questions provide a feedback at Akash, and then there's kind of like Choose Your Own Adventure path for individuals that are building, different video curriculum or creating technical blog posts or putting together the framework for zealy a community kind of task manager building functionality for So that's for funding the vanguards those individuals that are highly engaged and very involved in ecosystem making a cash what it is and then the other kind of

00:15:00

Adam Wozney: Adam is bounties and those will be basically kind of one-off opportunities for any Community member to build or do something that's beneficial to the ecosystem. So that proposal is up live right now on GitHub go review it leave your feedback and then hopefully before the end of the year or again early next year, we'll put it up for a funding prop and then we can move forward on all those things. That's it for the governance proposals. Any questions feedback thoughts on that before my maybe final two or three line items. Going Scott.

Scott Hewitson: To bring that up and then let's get a bounty for it. So it's like if a bounty has the support of a Sig or working group that's 10 times more likely to, get put forward. I really just want to empower the community to be able to do that.

Adam Wozney: Thank you Scott. And yeah, and if you want to get it more involved in that governance proposal or you have any questions or thoughts about that you can head over to the community Sig Channel leave your thoughts in there or head over to GitHub where the discussions taking place around the bounties and around the vanguards. So leave your thoughts in there. last couple things is Akash edu. So that is something that's been kind of Ebbs and flows throughout 2023. Basically the idea behind Akashi to you is to have a platform where

Adam Wozney: a future community members can learn about It'll have everything from how to deploy a provider using pretor to deploying on the Akash network using CLI or Cloud most we launched our first curriculum middle of last year and we learned a lot from that but then it got kind of pushed by the wayside because there's other priority items that people had to work on but we're at the point where I think we can kind of revitalize the Akash edu platform. It's hosted on omniflex right now. They have a timeline of December 20th to update the sign up flow. That's one of the biggest hurdles people are having right now for Akashi to you is just getting access to the curriculum.

Adam Wozney: In a meaningful easily automated way. So they're updating their signup flow. So all you have to do is basically sign up with Kepler and you have access to the platform and then once you go through the quizzes and watch the demos and understand how to do these things you're going to nft saying you've completed these courses. So they're updating that sign up flow and we're gonna be adding three new curriculums. two are actually created by the community and one was created by a member of overclock Labs one is for purchase and staking akt one is her deploying on spheron and the other is for interacting with stable diffusion on Akash.

Adam Wozney: So those will be three new curriculums that we're adding we're looking at hopefully before the end of the year. It'd be good to give something to people while everyone's away on vacation and they want to get away from family. They can go take some courses on Akashi to you. But hopefully before the end of the year all these things will be live Akashi, you'll be updated and we kind of see how those things progress if you want to get involved in Akashi to you just head over again to the community Sig Channel and leave your thoughts in there. We're always looking for new curriculum to be created. So if you're interested in participating in that are getting involved heading the Sig Community Channel and Discord and let us know, final two things are first up is actually zeely. So one of our community members Insider and Vanguard who's on this call, actually thankfully Robert Del Rey him and actually one of our other insiders in vanguards. His name is Andre our Andrew you might have seen him in Discord or telegram they

Adam Wozney: Busy working on zeely which is essentially kind of a Choose Your Own Adventure quiz and task kind of framework for teaching people about different aspects of Akash, and it's something they've been working on for a number of months and it launched a few weeks ago and so far it's been taking off really well so big shout out to those guys for creating it but since Robert you're on the call. I wanted to see if you had any updates or quick thoughts on zealy where things stand there.

Robert Del Rey: Absolutely. Thank you Adam. Let me add the correct filter.

00:20:00

Adam Wozney: There we go. Perfect.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah guys as you say I'm silly is kicking off really good. I'm so happy to see the feedback we got so far. And the last month we've been doing some updates called we've been talking with Benji also will be helping a lot reviewing the missions and yeah Just for the recording as you say Seeley is a Community Management tool. It helps Community Builders to engage with their community be a missions. The mission can depend.

Robert Del Rey: How most projects use this is to create and Farm engagement, go to my Twitter retweet my stuff. But the way we're approaching silly on a cash is to make people build a stuff on a cash deploy this site on a cash or as for this talk in India cash test net and when they do that, we give them some experience point and some akt rewards. so that's a little context. We got a few phones to try this pilot. This Friday is gonna be two weeks since we started the pilot.

Robert Del Rey: And since then over 51 people have tried to interact with a cash silly, which I find that to be a great number. I mean in less than two weeks we got 51 people trying this platform Benji run the calculations today and if we pay out all the rewards today, we would pay out around 430 akt which is 40% of our budget for this prices. So since we want more people to get involved,

Robert Del Rey: We are going to extend this pilot. So this is an alpha your guys are getting for going in this meeting. We're actually extending this like you say Adam sometimes during the holidays people want to get away from their families. So in case you want to do that, you can step aside and do some silly missions. We're gonna extend this on for January fee. So it's gonna be three more weeks just so this way we can have more people try to build the stuff and earn more akd in their cash and next week have next Monday. We're gonna have our last working group call of the year in case you want to get involved or in case you want to know a bit more join that call. We'll share more updates over there. I will end it here, right?

Robert Del Rey: Want to think much of your time Adam, but yeah, long story short Series going really good. We have got lots of feedbacks and it's just getting better from here. Alright.

Adam Wozney: Very cool. Thank you for the update Robert. Yeah, there's a lot going on within zeely. I know you've been working on it for months and seeing it all actually coming together and launched as pretty cool and that's a completely community-owned kind of project. I remember when you kind of pitched the idea a number of months ago is called crew three at the time and I was like, this sounds awesome. I want to help out but there's a bunch going on but I think you got a handle it and to see you actually put it out there with help of other community members has been super cool so good job on that to get involved in the zealy working group. We have a zealy working group channel on Discord if you have thoughts feedback concerns head over there and that's where you can go for that.

Adam Wozney: My final update is actually just a short one. So this was a project put on by one of our community members. This has live for a number of months. I just put in the chat. It's sdxl and This is basically so you can create imagery using AI all on the Akash Network first time that's ever happened in decentralized way. completely Community owned and operated and I just wanted to highlight that as a really cool project that's live for a while and put on by the community. So if you're looking to do things like this head over to the Sig Community Channel join some of the other sigs that are happening inside of the Discord. That's where Kind of get involved in these kind of activities and actually launch your own Community owned projects like zeli or xdxl and Akash.

Adam Wozney: Beyond that that's really all I have for the day. Are there any other thoughts concerns agenda items you guys wanted to cover?

Adam Wozney: honestly that kind of does it for most of the sigs and calls for the year? There's maybe a few more next week in the week after but I think there's maybe three and then it's the new year. So I'm pretty stoked how this first year went in terms of special interest groups and working groups. But yeah, it's been good. But yeah look so we got one from Alani go for it.

00:25:00

Alani Kuye: Hey, what's going on guys? vertical question. Is there a channel on the Discord Some of us who are having fun with sdxl compose some of the cool images that we generated.

Adam Wozney: That's actually a fun idea. I'm gonna make a note of that. There isn't right now, but I think that's actually a fun idea post images. I know a lot of Discord channels have meme channels where it's Show Your Meme highlight. I mean the reason why I haven't really actively pushed for that or thought about putting up that particular specific type of channel is a lot of memes are kind of moon boy related where it's like watch their token pump and…

Alani Kuye: Yeah.

Adam Wozney: the Discord is definitely not that but sdxl on Akash that could be a little cooler because it's not like we're saying posterior, akt moon boy meme on bringing the token but post a cool picture of something that Is about anything as long as it's like…

Alani Kuye: That you sell.

Adam Wozney: what an interesting image? we exactly

Alani Kuye: Yeah that you just don't end up unstable diffusion, right?

Adam Wozney: Yep, exactly. I actually really like that idea any thoughts on that. I mean I'm gonna do it right after this call. I'm gonna create a channel and I'll kind of put in your images of what xdxl here. Yeah, I think it's a great idea.

Alani Kuye: That's a bit.

Adam Wozney: I mean there's been I don't know the exact number Scott you may know I know it's like thousands of yeah,…

Alani Kuye: 46,000 40 yeah Yeah.

Adam Wozney: 36,000 images, right 46,000. So I mean that's a lot of images. So I think that's actually a good idea accelerize. It's just people are making them and we don't know about it and we definitely want to highlight that in a tweet or something,

Alani Kuye: I think I did one yesterday on Twitter that I tagged a power show on. That kind of got some interesting reaction, which is kind of cool. That's where the idea came from. I wonder how many other people are doing the same thing and nobody knows about it, right?

Adam Wozney: Exactly and I might even here's an idea. What if I label it when I create the channel I say, have you created a really cool image? You want to share from xdsl on Tweet about it and share the link to your Tweet in this channel. So that way it's goes to Twitter and then it also shows up in the Discord and then we can reshare it or do whatever we want with it. I like that tweet about cool.

Alani Kuye: boom boom

Adam Wozney: I'm glad you joined the call Alani.

Alani Kuye: Hey, man, I'm always lurking.

Robert Del Rey: happy to see

Alani Kuye: Yeah, same to you.

Rodrigo Rochin: I don't think the square allows showing Twitter images anymore. And the embedded new things…

Adam Wozney: Really? interesting.

Rodrigo Rochin: since it turned to X so we would just see the link. Or maybe it will be a better to upload the image,…

Adam Wozney: I'll do some experimenting. We'll see I'll start a channel. Yeah, I'll do some short little experiments here to see…

Rodrigo Rochin: but that would be real cool telling.

Adam Wozney: If not, I'll put in some sort of lightweight directions. here's what you can do or…

Rodrigo Rochin: Yeah, that's a great idea too…

Adam Wozney: post here.

Rodrigo Rochin: because they will get to promote their Twitter, too.

Adam Wozney: Yep, exactly. So yeah, let me work on that beyond that anything else before we wrap up the final special interest group Community call of the year.

Adam Wozney: No, as always thank you guys for joining the community at Akash wouldn't be the community if it wasn't for you guys. Otherwise, it'd just be me in a Google Hangout recording this message to myself. So thank you guys for participating in the Akashi Community. Thank you for making it what it is. If you have any thoughts feedback questions head over to the Akash Discord the Sig Community Channel or join this thing calls and kind of get involved in different aspects of Akash that way but as always do I want to say thank you for joining and happy New Year and we'll see you in the metaverse. All…

Alani Kuye: All right.

Adam Wozney: You guys.

Robert Del Rey: Stay safe everybody. Thanks Adam.
