Adam Wozney: GMGM.

Adam Wozney: Hello.

Raphael Montana Müller: Hello guys.

Raphael Montana Müller: How's it going?

Adam Wozney: Thank Just pulling up my notes. Today's call. get some more people in here. We go.

Raphael Montana Müller: Are you two from the Akash team?

Adam Wozney: So I'm on kind of part of the core team,…

Adam Wozney: but technically there really is no one that works at Akos because it's open source, but I'm one of the folks that is involved in kind of helping sherple a lot of things. I head up community

Raphael Montana Müller: Yeah, cool.

Raphael Montana Müller: So, could we maybe talk about something that I like to discuss with you guys before the other community members come?

Raphael Montana Müller: Maybe. Okay.

Adam Wozney: Yeah, let me So,…

Adam Wozney: let me open my notes here. I always kick it off with agenda items and I can add you to the agenda items here.

Raphael Montana Müller: Sure thing.

Adam Wozney: So, let me give it another couple minutes here. See if some other folks can join.

Raphael Montana Müller: Sure thing.

Adam Wozney: 

Adam Wozney: One second here. So, I'm based in California,…

Raphael Montana Müller: Where are you guys from Which city?

Adam Wozney: San Diego.

Raphael Montana Müller: San Diego. I lived in Tahoe City for four months in 2020. I love California.

Adam Wozney: Yes, Tahoe is very cool.

Raphael Montana Müller: Yeah, the is beautiful.

Raphael Montana Müller: Perfect.

Adam Wozney: Give me one second.

Adam Wozney: Just updating my notes. Getting things ready here. Give another minute or two. Other folks can join. All right. That Okay.

Adam Wozney: All right, I think that should do it for now. yeah, let me add this here. Give me one sec. Getting some more people to join.  Pablo's Whoops. There we I have a handful of updates on the community side. Just getting my notes prepared and we can get into That okay.

Adam Wozney: share there. and one more All right, I think I can kick things off. Let me pull this all right. I didn't notice. Okay, I think we can start. So, I got my notes all welcome everyone to this month's SIG community call. It is March 11th. Can you believe it?

Adam Wozney: We're almost one quarter of the way through 2025. quick introduction for folks who don't recognize me. I'm Adam. I head up community activities for Akos. And today's call we have a handful of things that we're going to cover. We're going to kind of stick to the new agenda format that I started last month…

Adam Wozney: where we kind of go through the gov prop programs and activities. But before I get into any of that, wanted to kick it off with Any agenda items we have? It looks like Raphael, you might have an agenda item.

Raphael Montana Müller: Yes sir.

Raphael Montana Müller: I'm not sure if it's an agenda item. what I would like to talk about I talked to Bieber on Discord and…


### 00:05:00

Adam Wozney: What team action?

Raphael Montana Müller: Bieber told me to come here and talk about this. So I am from the Axon team. I know that some community members have reached out Axon.

Raphael Montana Müller: I'll post here on the comments x.comxy and our airdrop is live and we have selected 16 communities inside the cosmos ecosystem like lava bandash fi json nail secret met scientists and so on and I'd like to talk to you guys and understand how to better approach  this how to put the word out there to the community. most of these 16 projects have been engaging with us because it's a very different airdrop method. the community basically needs to argue with some AI agents to convince them that the community is eligible but it's just role play because everyone gets the air drop.

Raphael Montana Müller: But these discussions actually affect the amount of your drop to each community.

Raphael Montana Müller: So it's pretty fun. I like to talk to you guys understand how could we collaborate and how could I put the word out there to you? Sure.

Adam Wozney: Got it.

Adam Wozney: So, let's All right. So, I'll add you to the agenda. We'll maybe bust into that towards the end of the call. Is that all Any other agenda items anybody wants to add? All right. Cool. So, just for definition, we host a handful of SIG and working group calls at Akos. And the purpose and definition of our community call is really to discuss, support or manage any AOS community activities or programs.

Adam Wozney: most of which now are stemming from a handful of programs and activities that were launched at the beginning of this year. Some of them were continuation of what we've been doing over the past few years. Some of them are new. and they're all around the ecosystem and community support proposal that we put together and launched and was approved by the community at the end of December in 2024.  So, sticking with the kind of similar agenda that we did last month, I want to go through each one of the programs and each one of the activities and give updates on each one of those items. first one I wanted to talk about was the Vanguards program. and for folks that are unfamiliar with the Vanguards program, it's essentially our community support team. people that are part of that program help answer technical questions around AOS.

Adam Wozney: on Discord or on Telegram or on other social channels, usually specifically Discord. But one of the things that I started doing towards the end of last year, was having our 10 member Vanguard community fill out a support kind of feedback I guess you could say update. so I'm going to share those numbers and some of those statistics from last month's Vanguard feedback form. This is basically the kind of high level of some of the support quests and support that is needed by the Vanguard's community within Akos.

Adam Wozney: So in the top left corner here you can see if vanguards are getting support from the core team which is overclock labs. and you can see here 90% said yes there's one not available or not avail I'm assuming that doesn't mean that no they didn't get it just means they didn't need it which is Who good in terms of getting support thank you from core team members.

Raphael Montana Müller: Salute.

Adam Wozney: In the bottom left corner you can see the interaction with community members on satisfaction levels. So you can see that users or community members that are getting support from our community are either satisfied or very satisfied which is just a good number to track month over month.  I do have listed neutral or dissatisfied as well, but nobody said that they were neutral or dissatisfied, which It is something good to track month over month. There is really no change from January to February. So, everyone that's getting support inside of the Discord or Telegram channels are getting what they need, which is average technical questions per day. So, this is also a good number to track month over month.

Adam Wozney: You can see here that, 80% of our Vanguards are responding to, one to five somewhere in there tactical questions every single day inside of Discord or Telegram. we did have two people that said they were getting per day. and then also six to 10.  those 16 or more questions I think is an outlier and that's most that was mostly around the loyment tool or the deployment console that's a mouthful but basically we depreciated Ptor which was how people could point and click to add a provider to their network and we just launched the AOS provider console which helps people do the exact same thing but now in a different format and I think a lot of those questions were


### 00:10:00

Adam Wozney: from that. So, I'm assuming that this is a one-off and we should go back from what we were in the previous month, which is around, 80% of people are getting one to five questions per day and then a couple people are getting a few more questions on different aspects of the network. It's also a good number to track month over month because if we're getting more, that means there's either an issue that needs to be solved or it just means that there's more people using the network. So, it's just a good number to track kind of month over month.  And then the final thing you see in the bottom right corner here is the main support themes for the month. And this again really didn't change from January to February. It's generally questions around deployments. It's questions around becoming a provider or it's a quest questions around how to interact with the AOS console which is kind of the main hub for people to get their deployments up onto the network. So wanted to share that.

Adam Wozney: I think this is a good thing to share with the community to showcase, the impact of the Vanguards because without them, a lot of these questions would not be answered. I'm guessing the satisfaction levels would go way down because people are getting their questions answered in time. So, big shout out to everyone who's in the Vanguards community helping out with those things. any questions on Vanguards before moving on to our next community program? Nope. All right, cool.  So, next up is Ring Masters. So, for folks that aren't familiar, Ring Masters are local community event organizers. they're folks who are actively hosting events in their local regions introducing people to Akos and last month was really our first month of regular scheduled events.

Adam Wozney: so what I'm sharing here is the Akos community events kind of channel inside of our Discord. So these are the past events that happened over the past month or so. And you can see they're happening all around the world. Usually tailored right now towards India and Africa, but I definitely want to see if we can scale that out to other regions. Previous to this, last year we had events in Sweden and then some in the States, but I'm expecting that we'll have more going into the rest of the year.  Currently we have I believe 10 ring masters who are paid on a per event basis. So if people are hosting an event they get support from the community pool to actually host those events and fund those activities. But here you can see all the previous events that took place over the past month and beyond. And then if we go to upcoming you can see a couple of the upcoming events that we have scheduled on the docket.

Adam Wozney: last month I believe we held six or seven ring master events introducing almost a thousand people to Akos which is pretty cool. So I'm hoping that we can kind of continue to scale up the events programming and get more and more involved in local community activities. So any questions on the Rig Masters program before moving on to the next agenda item? All right,  Next up is navigators. So navigators is a very new program. It's kind of the newest program as a part of our kind of ecosystem support proposal. And navigators are essentially folks that work with individuals, projects or organizations and help them onboard onto aos. The best way you can think about navigators are they're kind of an enhanced more white glove service. vanguards who are technical support on discord.

Adam Wozney: Currently we have five nav navigators who are senior navigators. those are individuals getting rewarded for helping projects deploy onto Akos. And then we have several junior community navigators who are kind of testing the waters seeing if it makes sense for them to kind of get more involved and become kind of a full-time I guess senior navigator helping into projects and deploy onto the network.  Currently we have I believe 12 different clients we can call them but essentially they're organizations projects that the navigators are actively helping kind of onboard onto the network.  These are numbers that we're going to track month over month and week over week. so hopefully as the program progresses we can take those 12 clients or users. and then next month we can say six of them have deployed and they're actively working on the network and then six are still in the funnel and maybe we even have a few more that are a part of the program.


### 00:15:00

Adam Wozney: So you can see actively their work through active deployments onto the network. that's kind of it for Any questions on the navigators program? No. Cool. And then the final leg of the community programs are and alchemists are people who are actively creating content or curriculum for Akos edu. the idea behind the alchemist program is sourcing community members that have a background in education.

Adam Wozney: having them actually create specific curriculum around the Akash network that people who want to better understand how to interact and use AOS can go and go to AOS edu take courses that teach them about how to do different aspects of the network and kind of actively get more involved that's turnkey free and go at your own pace. So this is a program that actually was established almost a year and a half two years ago.  We've gone through a few iterations of this and now we're at a point where we're actively working with community members and helping them kind of create curriculum that teach people about Akos. there are currently I believe four or five alchemists that are actively creating courses focused on beginner courses. So there's going to be a beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

Adam Wozney: We want to get those beginner courses out the door and we're aiming for the end of Q2, which is end of June to launch several new courses as a part of Akos edu. a couple are under review. they're all at different stages in terms of completion of these individual courses that we've put together.  So hopefully by the end of June, we'll have a handful of new courses that we can actually showcase to the community and new community members joining and learning about Akos, which I'm really excited about. Any questions on the Alchemist program? All right. So I know there are a couple people that are part of these individual communities.

Adam Wozney: the Vanguards, community support, ring masters, local events, navigators, kind of BD kind of, integrations folks and alchemists, content creators. I wanted to see if there was anything anybody wanted to provide in terms of color as a part of those individual programs. I know Pablo, looks like Deathless and Rodri, you guys are all part of kind of different programs.  anything that you wanted to cover in terms of kind of your activities or just general thoughts around kind of being a vanguard, being a navigator, or Pablo even being an alchemist. Any questions, any thoughts, anything you want to provide in terms of color to those general highle updates of those programs? Feel free to raise your hand if you have anything. nothing.

Adam Wozney: Give me a thumbs up if you think the program.

Rodri R: Yeah, don't have much right now,…

Rodri R: but all really cool getting involved.

Adam Wozney: Good. Yeah, I know Roger, you're involved. You've been an OG at Cos Insider for a while, so you've seen a lot of different things. And Deathless, you've been involved for a while as well. So, thank you guys for all the support you give to the community. all right. Deathless, always learn more every day. Absolutely.

Adam Wozney: And one final thing is I want to say so each one of those programs if anyone on this call or watching the recording wants to get involved the first leg of that is to apply to join the insiders program. And the insiders program is kind of the overarching umbrella that supports all those individual kind of community programs. there's no requirements for being an insider. all activities are optional. You kind of make it what you want to make it. You get involved where you want to get involved. and over the course of, being an insider, there is potential if you're interested to join those individual programs. Currently, I think the Vanguards, we're at a good state where we don't need to add anymore. However, we do have budget for more Vanguards, but I don't think we need anymore quite yet because, as you saw in that data, Vanguards are answering one to five questions per day. That's plenty.

Adam Wozney: if we start to get where, 80% of the Vanguards are responding to 10 or more questions a day, we might want to review. we might need some more Vanguards in the program. But at this stage, I think we're good there. Ring masters. really anyone can kind of get involved in that. as long as you join the insiders program. and those ring masters are paid rewarded per event that they host.  So that way we have a set aside budget that we can just kind of fill out as more people are hosting events. I am looking to scale the ring masters program to be outside of just events that are generally right now taking place either in Africa in different parts or in India. I would love to see pins on the map where we see events taking place all around the world but that'll just happen over time. Last month was really the first month of kind of the flywheel really moving.


### 00:20:00

Adam Wozney: So, as things progress, we'll see how that works out. Navigators, very similarly, we do have budget to add additional navigators. However, I think with the amount of incoming in terms of projects that navigators are helping, I don't think we need to add any more yet. But, once we do get more kind of incoming requests for people and projects that need vast resources from the network, I can see us adding more navigators to the program.  And then in terms of the alchemists, it's really like if you're interested in creating content, apply to be an insider and let us know that you're down to create some content for KashiU. all rewards are take place similar to events where they're paid per course that they put out or rewarded course they put out. But there are some, checks and balances along the way to make sure that people that are contributing to each one of those programs, are available.

Adam Wozney: they're hitting the requirements so they can get rewarded and kind of help kind of pursue those things that they want to work on and build out. So that's the update on community programs. Any questions before we move on to the portion of the community programs? All make sense? so there were four really activities that were part of the GU prop that we put at the beginning of last year. Hackathons, bounties, community events and Akos u. actually no not a edu. Let me get rid of that one. Really there's only three events or three activities. There's community events I'll talk about in a second. There are bounties I'll also talk about and hackathons.

Adam Wozney: Currently on the hackathon side, I know a handful of ring masters that are hosting local events do have connections with local hackathon organizations. so I'm meeting with individual ring masters that say, "Hey, it'd be cool if we could participate in this hackathon." So we need to review that. need to see if we want to sponsor it either from the hackathons's budget or from the ring masters budget because it's not a perfect science. I initially put a budget together sponsoring some larger tier hackathons that we could kind of get in front of and actually put together some kind of different activities as a part of those hackathons or our own hosted hackathons similar to what we've done in the past where we've hosted three AOSTons that were just hosted by us and then people could kind of get involved depending on what they want to do.

Adam Wozney: so the ring masters kind of hackathon layover or I guess crossover. Still thinking through exactly what that looks like in terms of support and involvement, but I do have a couple calls set up over the next week or two here to talk about some potential hackathons at a low level that Akos can involved in that will hopefully bring in some more community members. So that's update on hackathons to be honest, but there are a lot of hackathon opportunities that coming in. We just need to sus out, if it makes sense to get involved or how we can get involved in those things. So, I hope by next SIG community call, we should have some more hackathon updates on things that we're actually participating in and getting involved on the bounty side, I have been working with a community member.

Adam Wozney: Let me share my screen real quick. My computer is going very slow today. I need a new computer. But on the bounty side, I've been working with an AOS insider who has a background in creating bounties programs and she's actually launched this about three weeks ago, right before ETH Denver.  It's basically a framework for anyone that wants to contribute to Akos bounties to review what's expected of individuals. type talks about the types of bounties that we're looking to launch over the next few weeks here. talks about how to participate which is an application form and then check-ins, payments, and just getting started.

Adam Wozney: So, this doc that is on GitHub, you just go to discussions, you look at bounties, and then you can click and review the discussions taking place there. If you do want to potentially get involved in update or future bounties, you apply here. we'll review it and then we assign individuals to actually work on those bounties.  over the course of check-in process, if it seems that the people we've assigned are not hitting their marks, we'll review it and if needed, we'll pull them away from that and we'll look for someone else to actually complete those bounties. This is still very much a pilot. We're still working out the kinks and the bugs, but the first step is just apply saying you want to participate in a bounty.


### 00:25:00

Adam Wozney: And then hopefully over the next couple weeks here, we'll have some new bounties that we're launching probably at the beginner level just to kind of test out, who can contribute and then as people's technical skills kind of grow as participating in these bounties, we can start plugging them into more advanced bounties with higher rewards. So, this is something that we launched, a few weeks ago. So, if you are interested, head over to the GitHub, apply to the bounties program, and we'll see how things progress over the next few weeks. Hopefully, by the next SID community call, we'll have some bounties live and we can give some updates in terms of how many folks are actively building and working on these individual bounties that we're working on.

Adam Wozney: Last thing,…

Rodri R: What?

Rodri R: What repo is this? Sorry.

Adam Wozney: yeah, yeah.

Adam Wozney: just go to the Akos GitHub and discussions and then in the discussions you should see something a category that we just launched called bounty hunters and that's where that framework is. Cool. last part of the activities portion is community events. So this is an idea that kind of fits within the ring masters program.  So as you guys know my colleague Amanda she manages all of the Akash sponsored event that has its own governance proposal that it's gone through. we recently just wrapped up Denver. Next on the agenda next week is Nvidia GTC and there's a handful of other events throughout the year that the community has approved and said yes we should have an AAF presence there. So she's been managing what those presence looks like or what the presence at those events look like.

Adam Wozney: I put together a very small kind of pilot program where at those events, a lot of times Akos will go to those cities, we'll put on our event, we'll put on a booth, we'll host a side event, we'll get involved in other side events, and then we leave. However, a lot of those cities have crypto communities already established.  So the idea behind this is finding those local community leaders within crypto or AI or cloud, reaching out to them and hosting a very lightweight small sponsored event. And the idea is working with those individual community leaders and then having a local representative in those cities going forward. So we don't just go to a city and leave it.

Adam Wozney: We basically go to a city for these bigger conferences, find a local community established, set up some sort of small activity or meetup or something sponsored or otherwise, make a relationship with those individuals, and then when we leave those cities or when really the whole conference is over, we have a local community representative that we either add to the ring masters program as an event organizer or maybe even add as a Vanguard or a future insider.  So, we did one this past ETH Denver with a local crypto community. We hosted a small side event. and I'm currently works with working with that individual to introduce them to all the different activities that I've been mentioning here in this call that they can get involved in.

Adam Wozney: So my goal is that for future events where we go and kind of leave and go and leave I can kind of use this lightweight program to bring in more local community leaders so we can put pins in a global map of where a kosh representation is. and then they can lean on us for support and we can lean on them for future support for future event that might take place in those cities. So we hosted one meetup event in Denver over East Denver. It was really successful.  I made some good connections with some local community leaders and now I'm in the process of introducing all the different Akos insider and Akos activities with them so we can kind of utilize those individuals for future activities going forward. So that's the update on that. I don't have another event planned for Nvidia GTC but there might be the potential for future events. So stay tuned on the community event side. Any questions on those activities, hackathons, bounties or community events?

Adam Wozney: Nope. only other quick thing which I wanted to call out there are have one big event coming up that are part of the events proposal that my colleague Amanda has put together. ETH Denver is wrapped really successful. E Denver is one of my favorite crypto conferences. So I'm really happy we were attended there with a big booth. We hosted a side event.  We did a bunch of different side activities on panels on all sorts of really successfully feeber and now we're just following up with individuals that we connected with there. But the next big event is next week Nvidia GTC. This is traditionally a web 2 event. we went last year and it was really successful. So this year we're doing it again. I believe we're hosting a side event for Nvidia. We have a booth and we're going to be there over the course of three or four days.


### 00:30:00

Adam Wozney: we do have some insiders that are helping support our attendance there. if anyone again wants to attend and represent Akos for any of these upcoming sponsored events that we're going to be involved in, you can head to anetwork and check out our list of events that we have listed in the community page. and if you want to represent a kosh, you have to apply to be an insider. That's the only requirement.  apply to be an insider and the more involved you get, the more opportunities there are for you to actually represent a Kosh and support those activities at those events. So other than that, no really big updates on the event side. I think Amanda is working on a little bit of alpha for you guys.

Adam Wozney: our next Akos Accelerate which is our second full dayong Akos specific conference where we're bringing people to do panels speaking opportunities workshops all around Akos that'll be taking place this summer more updates on that to come but that's the next big thing and I know she's working on but there are other sponsored events that she's working on us getting involved in throughout the course of this year any questions on  coming sponsored events. Nope. All right. The last thing I wanted to call out was some governance proposals that I believe are live right now. So, let me see if I can pull up these Gov props. D. Here we go. Yes. So, we have three gov props that currently live.

Adam Wozney: Let me share my screen and we cover those really quickly. Share tab. there's two days left for the AOS inflation update proposal. There are two days left for the proposal to increase the community pool tax. And there are zero days left. So, is this over yet? I'm guessing it'll be over in the next few hours here on version 3.80.  80. It's an Akos mainet upgrade. just so you guys are aware, tomorrow we are, so if anyone's watching this recording, it might be old data, but tomorrow we're going to be going through an AOS mainet update. So, there will be a very brief period of time where the network won't be accessible, but I don't think it should be that long. I think the last one took less than five minutes, so you might not even notice It'll be a blip. But, they are working on a Kush network update or upgrade tomorrow.

Adam Wozney: and I think that's all part of, let's see, you can actually go to the proposal to read all about that. So, those are the three gov props that live right now. Definitely go in and review them, vote, make your voices heard. that's it for my agenda. Any questions on any of those items we had before we hand it over to Raphael to briefly talk about his proposal? No. All right, Raphael.  Yeah, we'd love to hear what you wanted to discuss.

Raphael Montana Müller: Yes Thanks for the replace. So yeah guys from the Exon team we are a AI collaborative protocol and we are launching our airdrop for the Cosmos ecosystem. We have chosen 16 communities.  I've mentioned some key lava akash batchi jackal sending out secret and three NFD projects mad scientists the bad kids and one more which I don't remember right now and it's a pretty fun airrop system so the community has to go to the website I have dropped the Twitter here on the comments because I don't want to be

Raphael Montana Müller: posting direct links for the airdrop. It's always best to come to our official Twitter and then click on the official link. And it's pretty fun and the Akash community is already eligible. So if you go to the airdrop, you will get your airdrop and the amount to be air dropped to each community depends on the battles. So what are these battles?  You submit your please. You basically argue with seven AI agents and you convince them that you are worthy the airrop.

Raphael Montana Müller: So the quality of the submissions from each community will define the allocation of airdrop and what I would like to do with you guys will be what we are doing with the other projects actually we are running some access spaces with some of them to talk about the airdrop for the community some cross promotions and I think it's a win situation because as you guys know the airdrop is a very good moment for all projects.


### 00:35:00

Raphael Montana Müller: So, we have lots of eyes on us right now. So, yeah, we definitely like to discuss about maybe scheduling an airdrop to talk to your community. we can host this air drop and so yeah, let me know what you guys think about that, what we could do and why we could be arranging

Adam Wozney: cool. Thank you,…

Adam Wozney: Raph. So, I'll give historical context. So historically, if you look at our Twitter, at least over the past, couple years, we really only do promotions around like integration partners or…

Adam Wozney: new features of the network. We really don't do any kind of promotions around airrops.

Raphael Montana Müller: Yes. Mhm.

Adam Wozney: That's not to say that this isn't valuable or interesting or important, but I'm just kind of giving you historical context. to be totally honest, I don't know exactly what we could do to help support that kind of fits our highlevel like marketing narrative. what exactly are you looking for us to help with?

Raphael Montana Müller: Has a question.

Adam Wozney: Yeah. Yeah, go for it, Rodri.

Rodri R: Yeah, I was just wondering is your token like a Cosmos SDK chain or…

Rodri R: is it minted or I don't know what blockchain or what kind of token is it or…

Raphael Montana Müller: Yeah, it's in Cosmos on Cosmos.

Rodri R: what does it have to do?

Raphael Montana Müller: Yeah, that's the relation all the …

Rodri R: So it has its own chain.

Raphael Montana Müller: so it's prettyg the token will be live on April. But yeah, the 16 communities we picked for the air drop are clos communities. So yeah, in answering your question, Adam, what I would like to understand is how to better approach this, how to better tell your community about the air drop because I know that some of the guys from our community have been joining discords and talking and I want to make sure that we put the word out there in the right way that we don't spam discord.

Raphael Montana Müller: So what some projects are doing is opening channels for people to drop submissions and ask about the drop and…

Raphael Montana Müller: some projects are doing access spaces with us. So maybe if we could have one of you guys from your team on a spaces hosted by us talking about this and having your community listening that would be good too. I only want to make sure that we put the word out there for your community the right way.

Adam Wozney: Right. …

Adam Wozney: I don't really have a good clear answer for you because I was kind of saying, we don't really promote any airdrops.

Raphael Montana Müller: Yeah. Yeah.

Adam Wozney: We've been hit up by four by projects that are totally legit. they make a lot of sense and they want to highlight their airdrop to our community and then let their communities know about Kosh and how to get involved. To be honest, a lot of the content that we put out there, whether it's a blog post, an email campaign, Twitter, is around integration partners like people…

Raphael Montana Müller: Mhm.

Adam Wozney: who have integrated into aos case studies or technical kind of understandings if you go to our Twitter, you can see most of the stuff we put out now is here's an event we're going to be at or here's a new feature of Akos chat or here's a new integration in Akos that you might want to be aware of. we don't really talk about Akos the AKT token on our Twitter. the only place where people talk about tokens our is a telegram channel that we don't even own or operate. It's communityowned called AKT price and…

Adam Wozney: staking. I would actually have to look I haven't interacted with that channel in a while. I would have to see who the organizer or the admin of that channel is. but you can always go on there and talk about airdrop stuff. But yeah,…

Raphael Montana Müller: Okay. Yeah.

Adam Wozney: and even on Discord, we were getting a lot of spam as I'm sure all crypto Discords are. So, we've blocked a lot of any content related to new airdrops. So, somebody posts like a link,…

Raphael Montana Müller: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Adam Wozney: even if it's legitimate and it says, "Here's a new airdrop you guys should be aware of, you're interested in," it's totally blocked just because we're getting so much spam and all the content on Discord really is geared technical.  So people that want to get their questions answered around how to deploy something on a kosh or how to become a provider or what it takes to be a validator or just general questions around their deployments. So to be honest there really I don't know of a clear answer for it might not be the answer you're looking for. I don't know what that would look like.


### 00:40:00

Adam Wozney: The best thing I could say is if you want to start a discussion around what this kind of promotion or…

Raphael Montana Müller: Sure.

Adam Wozney: community kind of like marketing arrangement would look like would be head over to get our GitHub discussions. We have multiple categories in there on AI announcements, bounty hunters, economics, general chats, governance proposals. sometimes governance proposals don't have to be requests for funding. It could just be like, "Hey, I want to do this. are you guys interested?" And we really let the community kind of decide. And generally how that works is if somebody posts something that's interesting, the more engagement there is in the community, the more likely that there will be some sort of interaction.

Raphael Montana Müller: You sure?

Adam Wozney: It's like, "Okay, community is very interested in doing this. Let's see if we can spin this up." But ultimately, it's kind of a community decision.  A lot of things are driven by kind of community approval, community interest levels. So, Discord probably isn't the place to go to kind of ask for support or give an idea of that. I would say go to GitHub, review some of the things that are in there. There's even an ideas category where you could say, "Hey, here's an idea. I'm part of this project. We're looking to do this. Here's how I think the Akos community could get involved and here's how we could support the Akos community."

Adam Wozney: that's probably your best bet for kind of moving something this along. But ultimately,…

Raphael Montana Müller: Okay, thank you a lot.

Adam Wozney: yeah, I'd say that's the place to go.

Raphael Montana Müller: Okay, thank you. Perfect. Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted because it's normal for the community that they want to help and they want to put the word out there.

Raphael Montana Müller: So I'm reaching out to the core team members to make sure that we are doing this the right way because the last thing we want is to I don't know make it sound spammy or…

Raphael Montana Müller: make it sound sketchy. Yeah. So thank you. I will definitely u go to GitHub check there and maybe push this conversation there.

Adam Wozney: Totally. Yeah.

Adam Wozney: Cool. …

Raphael Montana Müller: Okay. Thank you Adam.

Adam Wozney: for Thank you, Any other agenda items today before we maybe wrap up today's All right, that's it. thank you guys for joining our SIG community call.  We're wrapping it up a little bit early today, which is totally fine by me. I need some rest. but if you do have any questions, comments, concerns, you can always head over to the SIG community channel in Discord. these calls are public. They're recorded. So, you can always check them out later. But other than that, thank you guys for joining and we'll see you in one month in April for the next SIG community call. Thank you guys for joining.  See you in the metaverse, everybody.

Rodri R: And I'll see you in the metaverse.
