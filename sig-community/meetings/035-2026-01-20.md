## Meeting Notes

### Opening Remarks & Context Setting

* Joe Deng welcomed participants and introduced himself as Akash’s new Community Manager
* He acknowledged technical issues from the previous week that prevented attendees from joining
* Joe confirmed hosting and recording permissions were now properly set to avoid future disruptions
* The session was positioned as a reset and foundation-setting meeting for 2026 community efforts

### Akash Club Overview and 2026 Programming

* Joe shared that Akash community programming for 2026 has officially begun
* A closed kickoff networking event was held for insiders, student ambassadors, and core contributors
* The kickoff event was used to test internal processes before scaling to the broader community
* A public-facing event, Akash Club 2026, was hosted as the first external community event
* The event reviewed Akash’s 2025 milestones and outlined expectations for 2026
* Over thirty community members registered, with roughly half attending live
* Joe noted that attendance consistency is expected to improve as the cadence stabilizes
* Akash Club was announced as a weekly recurring community initiative

### Event Formats, Recaps, and Scheduling

* Recaps will be produced for roadmap, feature, and technical-focused events
* Social and networking events such as gaming nights will not receive formal recaps
* Recap frequency is expected to average two per month depending on event mix
* An upcoming gaming and networking event was announced for the following Saturday
* Joe highlighted challenges in scheduling due to Akash’s globally distributed community
* The team will continue experimenting with time slots to maximize participation

### Purpose and Philosophy of Akash Club

* Akash Club is designed to engage both technical and non-technical community members
* Joe emphasized reducing gatekeeping and making Akash more accessible
* The club aims to help the broader community better understand Akash’s mission and direction
* Planned formats include AMAs, research talks, developer presentations, workshops, trivia nights, and networking sessions
* Akash Club is run by insiders, with an open invitation for new contributors to help operate events

### Community Roles, Discord, and Engagement Channels

* Community members were encouraged to bring their unique skills and specialties
* Instructions were provided on how to obtain the Akash Club role in Discord
* The Akash Club chat was described as a social-first space distinct from general support channels
* Joe stressed the importance of culture-building within the clubhouse environment
* Alternative engagement channels, including Telegram and X were confirmed for non-Discord users

### Community Program Restructuring and Bounty Board

* Several legacy programs, including Contributors, Ring Masters, and Alchemists, were sunset
* These programs were consolidated into a single unified bounty board
* The bounty board will include opportunities for content creation, application development, and issue resolution
* Participation will be skill-based rather than role-restricted
* Vetting processes will remain in place to ensure quality and accountability
* Benjamin B was announced as the lead managing bounty applications and reviews

### Future Outreach and Affiliate Program Concept

* Joe introduced the idea of a future affiliate-style outreach program
* The program would allow non-technical contributors to support Akash adoption
* Community members could be rewarded for facilitating qualified business introductions
* Coordination with Akash’s sales leadership would be required to avoid overlap
* Joe emphasized that community-driven outreach can scale beyond what a single sales team can reach

### New Initiative: Vibe-Coded Applications

* Joe introduced a new initiative focused on simple, vibe-coded applications
* These apps are intended to showcase Akash’s capabilities rather than generate revenue
* Example ideas included profile roasters, daily voice journals, and location-based utilities
* Applications would visibly reference Akash as the infrastructure provider
* GitHub repositories and deployment templates were suggested to encourage reuse and learning
* Community members were invited to submit additional app ideas via Discord

### Advanced Community-Built Applications

* Joe outlined a second, more advanced initiative involving larger collaborative applications
* Past projects such as Akash Chat and Akash VPN were referenced as successful models
* These projects started as community efforts and later evolved into supported services
* Open-source AI models, privacy, and decentralization were highlighted as key strengths
* Cost efficiency was discussed as one advantage among several, not the sole value proposition

### Regional and Country-Level Community Discussion

* George Pro asked about plans for country-level or regional community leadership
* Joe explained that previous regional lead programs were paused due to budget constraints
* The impact of AKT price conditions on community funding decisions was acknowledged
* No immediate plans exist to reinstate paid regional lead roles
* Joe noted that future reconsideration is possible depending on ecosystem conditions

### Zealy Program Update and Contributor Rewards

* Benjamin B provided an update on the Zealy program
* A decision was made to discontinue Zealy in its current form
* No additional community funds will be requested for Zealy activities
* Remaining funds will be used to wrap up outstanding contributor rewards
* The November contributor contest was postponed due to low participation
* The December contributor reward proceeded with a winner selection
* Swag contests were cancelled temporarily pending financial clarity
* No Zealy contests will run for January
* George Pro was selected as the December contributor reward recipient
* Wallet address submission was requested via direct message if not already provided

### Closing Remarks

* Joe confirmed that future contests and engagement activities will run through Akash Club
* Community members were encouraged to continue sharing feedback and ideas
* Joe reiterated his availability through Discord, Telegram, and open office hours
* Participants were thanked for their time and engagement
* The meeting concluded with plans to reconvene the following month

  \
**Joe Deng:** Hey Ben, how's it going? Hey Ben, how's it going? So, it looks like I can uh let people in now, which is awesome. \
**Benjamin B:** Yeah. What happened last time? Were you not a \
**Joe Deng:** I was not a uh admin last time. So basically uh Tyler had set Amanda as the administrator of the call and she wasn't there and Tyler was busy at the moment too. So no I was the only one that showed up and I was unable to let everybody in. So this time around we are ensured that I can let people \
**Benjamin B:** Yeah, I think I waited like 10 or so minutes last time and then then I got kicked \
**Joe Deng:** in. Me too. I was waiting too. I was like, "Oh, I see you got kicked out." I was like, "Nobody's coming?" That That's kind of sad. \
**Benjamin B:** out. \
**Joe Deng:** I guess nobody cares. So, uh, this will be a little bit different. But I guess now that we are figured out, I just got to figure out how to do the recording now because Oh, never mind. \
  \
 


### 00:01:12

  \
**Joe Deng:** There's a button up here that says record. It's actually already recording right now. I guess I will stop it and I'll re \
  \
 


### Session ended after 00:01:20

 


### 00:13:51

  \
**George Pro:** It's \
**Joe Deng:** All right. Hello everybody. Welcome to the SIG community on January 20 \
**George Pro:** called \
**Joe Deng:** 20th on Tuesday. Uh sorry about last week. I know we had a slight technical difficulty and uh you know now we're rescheduled. So for those of you that don't know me, my name is Joe. I also go by Caleum and I am Akash’s new community manager and this will be my first SIG where I am hosting. So I hope you forgive me if we uh go through some hiccups but I wanted to spend some time here to talk about our community updates and how 2026 has started and how we're going to move it forward with all of the events that we have planned. So our community programming is already underway. We just had our first kickoff networking event at the start of this month which was exclusive to insiders, student ambassadors, and other people that I consider core to our base community. \
  \
 


### 00:14:55

  \
**Joe Deng:** I think we had a great celebration and it was a good first event because I was able to run through a lot of the processes that I wanted to make sure worked and that was a great start before we opened it up to everybody outside of that community as well. And we actually had that event last week. We ran a event called Akash club 2026 where I went over some of the things that happened with Akash 2025 as well as the things that we can look forward to in 2026. And I thought that event was pretty well attended and that was our first external event open to everybody. We had over 35 people sign up but ultimately I think there was like 16 17 people that ultimately showed up to the event and that was our first public event. So today I'm working on a recap so I can send that out to those of us that weren't able to make the event live. Um Akash Club is going to be running weekly events and every week you might not be able to make all of them. \
  \
 


### 00:15:53

  \
**Joe Deng:** So in case that you don't make all of them and you or you miss one, make sure that you're a part of our mailing list and there will usually be a recap every other week. So, some weeks we have events like this week coming up on uh this Saturday at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, we're going to have another event. This is more going to be like an Akash gaming event. So, it's really for the community to network, get to know each other, and play some games together and make it more comfortable, less awkward. And so, we won't have any recaps for events like that. But for events like the one I had last week about you know roadmap or maybe about new features I know BME is coming up soon. So you can expect an event around that sometime in the future. So those events are going to get recaps and so we're going to run on a frequency of one recap like maybe two recaps a month. So it just depends on what event is run that that time. \
  \
 


### 00:16:47

  \
**Joe Deng:** And uh yeah so that is what we're doing for our events. And let's see what else I have going on. So yeah, so anyway, I want to talk about the purpose of Akash club. So the purpose of Akash club is really to engage our active community as well as our insiders as well as our students and we we really the purpose is to encourage more people to join our community. We want to make the tent a lot bigger. So even if you don't have any technical skills um you know we encourage you to come join our events and kind of keep up to date on what Akash is up to. We don't really want to gatekeep that information. We want to have everybody who wants to access it to be able to access it. And we want to help you on on the outside community to understand Akash a little bit easier. Uh to understand how it works, understand where we're going and so that everybody can be on the same page about what our mission is. \
  \
 


### 00:17:38

  \
**Joe Deng:** And we're going to mix in some serious stuff like research or AMAs with the core team, presentations by maybe different developers. Uh maybe we'll have workshops as well. And we want to mix that in with some light-hearted community building events such as trivia nights. We'll have some game nights. We'll have our usual uh networking events. So uh and our next networking event is going to be at the end of this month. It's also going to be on a Saturday. So, I hope that more and more people can make these events. And right now, we're trying to figure out what is the best time. We do have an international community. So, you know, it's always going to be somebody's uh sleeping time. It's always going to be somebody's early morning. So, we're going to try our best to figure out where our core group is and find a time that works for the most people. Uh let's see what else I've got going on. \
  \
 


### 00:18:31

  \
**Joe Deng:** So with the so Akash club is actually run by a group of insiders and we are hoping that as more people join up that more people will join our insiders group that to help run the event. So we want you to bring your specialties. If you know something about vibe coding which I'll talk a little bit more about later I want you to be uh part of the group. So if you feel like you have something to contribute, please, you know, uh check us out at our clubhouse within our discord and you guys can get the role of a \
**George Pro:** Thank you. \
**Joe Deng:** AKash club role by going into the ro section and just clicking the party icon and that'll give you the role and access to our community chat. And that community chat how it differs from the general chat is general chat might have a lot of people asking for assistance, asking for support and it's not really made for more social atmosphere. So really hoping to build out the culture there within our clubhouse chat. So I hope that we'll see you there. \
  \
 


### 00:19:28

  \
**Joe Deng:** And just in case you're not a Discord user, we are available on Telegram and on X as well. So feel free to join any of those Akash club uh satellites and inter uh integrate with us there. All right. Um no questions. I assume I think I've said that to a lot of you already that are on this call. So this is just to for anybody that has not been to any of our events so far. All right. I want to talk a little bit about previous programs that we had. So we had to sunset a few programs already such as the contributions program, ring masters, alchemists. They were all just different subsets of the same thing one way or another in terms of what insiders can do. So I've reorganized that under one larger bounty board. So I'm working currently working on a bounty board for insiders. So at the end of the day what I hope is that you'll be able to find abil opportunities to create content for Akash to develop applications for Akash to fix issues open issues for Akash as well and all of those will be within the bounty board. \
  \
 


### 00:20:39

  \
**Joe Deng:** So instead of saying that you have to be an alchemist in order to create content, we're going to remove that. So anybody can participate and join in on it. There will still be vetting processes to make sure that obviously you guys can do the bounty that you have to do, but overall it would be more open. So we're not forcing certain people to do certain things and other people to be uh uninvited to do it. So, if you have the prerequisite skills, really encourage you to sign up for those bounties. And I want to announce that uh Benjamin, Piber here on the call is going to be in charge of managing that and looking through all the applications. So, uh as we move forward and you have any questions, feel free to ask him. Feel free to ask the general chat of Clubhouse and we'll all be very happy to speak with you about that. So there are many other plans that I want to talk about, but I think that at the end of the day, what's important is what's in front of us. \
  \
 


### 00:21:37

  \
**Joe Deng:** So my main goal right now is really to uh jumpstart the early community and to set up the infrastructure to really have people come through and retain our community members in one group setting, which is what uh what Akash club is main for. That is the main priority. But I'm going to give you guys just a little bit of a hint on what I'm thinking about in the coming future and you can expect to see some form of it, you know, in the next few months. Uh, one thing that I'm thinking about is adding to our bounties opportunities, creating an affiliate program for our insiders. So for those that maybe can't do content or don't have the technical skills, everybody can learn about Akash and and be well-versed in it and be able to join our affiliate program to push Akash towards different applications that you might be using right now. So I myself use a few AI applications for my workflow and I approach all of them and tell them about Akash and about how they can have their inference for a lot cheaper by going through Akash ML or other services that Akash has. \
  \
 


### 00:22:46

  \
**Joe Deng:** So my goal would be to produce some sort of affiliate program in conjunction with the head of sales Remington and make it so that obviously we don't want to step on his shoes. He's going to go do outreach for certain people. And so I want to create a program like that so that everybody can join and basically be rewarded if we're able to set up a good meeting for uh Remy and basically affect more business onto the network. Yes, Rodri. \
**Rodri R:** Just a quick note, deploying on Akash and using AI and Akash is not cheaper. It's less expensive and more convenient. \
**Joe Deng:** Mhm. Okay. I mean, at the end of the day, we really just a lot of the times the problem is that people don't know that AOS is an option. And so, we really want to be able to push that out and be able to offer what it is that we offer, right? I think a lot of it is outreach. And so, while we can all sit around and wait for the head of sales to reach out to individual businesses, there's going to be a lot more opportunity out there that is not um that is not reached out to, right? \
  \
 


### 00:23:54

  \
**Joe Deng:** like the Remington can't actually reach out to every single developer in the world. So that's why I hope that the community can contribute and pitch in a part of that. So uh currently I don't really have much more in terms of information than the wish to establish some sort of affiliate program. So I hope to provide you guys more information as that project goes along. Uh, another thing that assuming no more questions here from from you guys because that is the new piece of information. I'll give you like a second. All right, we'll move on then. Uh, another initiative that I really want to showcase is I'm going to try to create a few two two new initiatives, right? Similar in nature. So, the first is going to be easier. I think if there's anybody in our community that is wellversed in vibe coding and have built out vibe coded apps before it doesn't have to be a full-fledged thing that you make a business out of just maybe you vibe coded a few things for yourself I think you qualify if you have interest in helping Akash vibe code some apps that runs on Akash I think that that is going to be a uh a bounty uh section in the near future we are currently trying to gather ideas on what kind of apps would do great. \
  \
 


### 00:25:14

  \
**Joe Deng:** I think I would like to maybe give an example or two so that we can kind of get the get the juices rolling in terms of the creative juices. Just let me bring that bring that ideas list up. So, here are a couple of vibecoded ideas that I think would do great on Akash to and and the goal here is really to show the public uh spread awareness that these things are capable of running on Akash and that they can also edit it for themselves. So, uh somebody on the core team created a LinkedIn profile roaster. So, the whole point is that AI will roast your profile and of course you can, you know, use this to put in your own LinkedIn profile and then have it roast you as well. So that that's like an idea of like a simple app. It doesn't necessarily have to do anything. It doesn't have to be like a business or anything like that. It just has to be something fun. Uh something that could perhaps go viral and and have a lot of people go and try to roast themselves, right? \
  \
 


### 00:26:08

  \
**Joe Deng:** And and use that. And somewhere on the application page is obviously going to be powered by Akash and whatnot. So really a this is just an initiative to share and to uh promote awareness of Akash. And another example, some of the examples I thought of would be like a a daily journal that records my day. So, uh I want to be able to speak uh my my my you know, I I do a one like a one line a day journal. It's not supposed to be like a long diary entry. It's just a little bit of like what I did today. And so, I think it'll be great to have a app that I can verbally speak into the system about what I did today and have it transcribed and then keep the dayto day and then perhaps they can generate an image. uh to to go with my day and just record the date. That's it. So very very simple. And perhaps I can deploy that on Akash as a standalone app and then uh what I would want is I want want other people be like, "Oh, that's cool. I really want I like that idea and maybe they want to deploy their own version of that, \
  \
 


### 00:27:08

  \
**Joe Deng:** right?" And so to have some sort of GitHub repo that hosts that maybe on your own personal repo and then we can link to that and the purpose is to show a variety of different apps that our community has come up with and have vibe coded and basically connect that likely with a template to Akash and then how to deploy your very own on Akash. So it's kind of like that in nature. I'll give one more example again just to show what we're trying to accomplish here. Um, maybe another app could be something that draws a five mile or five minute walking radius around where my personal location is. So maybe I put in a some my my GPS data and whatnot and it draws a fivem minute walk circle and tells me where I can go grab lunch, you know. So something like that will be, you know, hopefully easily vibe coded and we can host that onto our uh our network and basically give people use of the app for free. it it you know it doesn't sell anything it just is a useful app and hopefully we'll then again have a link back to Akash about how this is powered by Akash and whatnot so that's like kind of the idea here so I would love to open the floor uh and this is going to be something that we're going to do within our uh clubhouse on discord of you know anybody have ideas to add to the list we want to build a big list of \
  \
 


### 00:28:28

  \
**Joe Deng:** possible app ideas and then we want to make them into bounties so people can start deploying them and making them work and and whatnot and then promoting them on their own socials. So that's like one of the other things that are coming up on the pipeline in terms of how we want to engage the community to assist in pushing the marketplace forward. So that is kind of like the easy baby step. Uh second to that is going to be like a level two where we are going to look towards building a larger app for Akash that runs on Akash. So in the past we've done a few things. We've done something that was super successful. Akash chat. Akash chat was a uh you know a chat GPT like application that Akash just you know basically you know for a lack of a better word copied and uh put onto Akash and powered it with open- source um models and made it with privacy and all those things that we cared about. So we edit it. \
  \
 


### 00:29:28

  \
**Joe Deng:** we took what was you know uh the chatbot and then we copied it and then we put in our own flavor into it. So I would like to explore doing something similar to that and producing another application on Akash. Uh we've also produced something similar to that which is AkashVPN is kind of what I have in mind if you guys were involved with AkashVPN. It was basically a group project where we split out the contributions and everyone built a little piece and it came together and we we had a uh an app basically. And so I'll be looking to do something similar to that but more in the vein of AI using the open source models. I think there are a lot of really cool open source models these days. Uh as I was talking about that journal that daily journal uh there is an open source app that is similar to uh 11 labs that is apparently very very good. And so the idea is that we can build uh dictation apps right and power that by Akash and as uh Rodri has said something about cheaper or whatnot. \
  \
 


### 00:30:30

  \
**Joe Deng:** Uh it's not always based on what's cheaper but we are able to give that service for a little bit of a lower price than perhaps what somebody running on AWS is able to give right so that is the core advantage. It's not the only advantage of a gosh. Right? We still have other things like censorship resistance and you know being decentralized and whatnot. Uh but the idea is that you know the price competition is very is one of the stronger points of Akash and so when we rebuild apps like this if we were to let's say build a community dictation app we can actually have that service for for a lower price than what others are able to do because we're not paying AWS right and so I'll be looking for ideas for that as well. So that's two ways to contribute. On the easier route, you've got your vibe coding route, simply be able to, you know, talk with AI and vibe code apps that you can post up. And then on the harder route, a more group setting route, we have uh perhaps a deeper application that we can build on Akash and charge for it uh and build that out. \
  \
 


### 00:31:34

  \
**Joe Deng:** And my goal is to copy the format that Akash chat was, right? Akash chat started as a community thing and then eventually it turned out to be uh you know I would say Akash API for example became Akash ML and that itself is a full-fledged service supported by the core team. So I think that that would be uh the victory the the the goal path you know if we're able to reproduce that success I would find that to be a very successful initiative for the community to undertake and uh yeah and so that's really the the general idea of where I see us I don't want to be too aggressive uh you know to truth be told I am still new to my role so I am trying to flex the muscle stretch out see where everything is and try to set a a base of trust with the community and and to me that is first and foremost going to be Akash club uh to trust that we're going to have weekly events to trust that we will be present uh over time and and from there we can build bigger things on top of that foundation. \
  \
 


### 00:32:38

  \
**Joe Deng:** Uh so I'm going to see if anybody has any questions here from the community here. Uh and for those of you that are listening to this recording later on, I often have open office hours. So, every time that I am working, I'm generally in what I call the Akash Club office. So, you can feel free to stop by there, ask your questions. If you wanted to be more one-on-one, you can always chat with me in the clubhouse on Discord. You can find me on Telegram, uh, in the official Akash Telegram chat, and you can find me in the price chat as well. So, I'm pretty much available in a lot of community avenues. So, you can find me and uh, we can chat about this as well. So, any questions here from the group that's uh present today? Going once, going twice. Okay. Uh with that, \
**George Pro:** Okay. So, \
**Joe Deng:** that is Yeah, \
**George Pro:** uh Joe, \
**Joe Deng:** go ahead, \
**George Pro:** do you have a question? \
  \
 


### 00:33:32

  \
**Joe Deng:** George. \
**George Pro:** Okay. So, uh previously like we were  trying to do some stuff at the country level like do you have plans for things at the country level where maybe you're going to build communities at the country level like ambassador and the country level or like plans for country level stuff. \
**Joe Deng:** Uh are you talking about events on the country \
**George Pro:** No, \
**Joe Deng:** level? \
**George Pro:** not even like I think I was trying to form \
**Joe Deng:** Uh \
**George Pro:** something. Yeah. \
**Joe Deng:** okay. \
**George Pro:** Like regional leades  for for various community for various countries or for various insider that represented in in the country. \
**Joe Deng:** Uh \
**George Pro:** So I'm trying to understand if you have plans for that mention anything like \
**Joe Deng:** yeah, sure. I can talk more about that. So, \
**George Pro:** that. \
**Joe Deng:** the regional leads was uh something that Adam was trying to incorporate and and to and to build out. So, my glasses ran out of battery. So, uh you guys can still hear me, right? \
  \
 


### 00:34:40

  \
**Joe Deng:** Yeah. Thumbs up. Good. Uh, so that was something that that Adam was trying to build out. And so for me, I don't really have a uh whatchamacallit I I don't really have any intention of continuing with that program only because uh the program as was stated is pretty hefty on the fund on the funds and whatnot. And as we all know uh AKT has seen better days and so we're really trying our best not to hit the community funding for as much as possible. We are trying to minimize the effect of the actions that we do as a community on our community pool and we're trying to find different ways that we can add value to Akash as a whole without without having to uh you know use a lot of those funds and so that program itself as it was advertised has now been delayed and uh is it possible that I could look for having regional leads in the future? I think the future anything is possible but as it currently stands you know that's not something within the confines of my budget that I want to spend and so I really want to use my budget very carefully uh and and my goals is to build out the community as well uh in terms of building country level communities that's less of an effort on on my end at the moment and we'll we'll see where things go as the year goes on uh you know if uh hopefully you know things work out \
  \
 


### 00:36:06

  \
**Joe Deng:** on the it for us and we are going to have more wiggle room and more space to do uh grander things. So hopefully that answers the question. I'm gonna since my glasses off I don't really have any way to hear you guys. So I'm going to go ahead and make sure that uh can somebody say something so I can check my speaker? \
**George Pro:** Oh my \
**Rodri R:** Check. \
**Joe Deng:** Yeah, I I can't hear anybody. \
**George Pro:** god. \
**Joe Deng:** Give me one minute while I set that up again. Speaker is all right. All right. Can somebody say something again? Hello. \
**Rodri R:** Hello. \
**Joe Deng:** Thank you, Roger. Okay, that works. All right. Uh hopefully I if you responded back to me, I didn't hear you. Uh if you have any more comments on that, please speak now so I can answer towards that. No. No. Okay, \
**George Pro:** Okay. \
**Joe Deng:** cool. Any other questions about anything at all before uh I'm going to let you guys go? \
  \
 


### 00:37:01

  \
**Joe Deng:** I think that's all I have for today's update for SIG community. No. All good. All right. Uh, yes, Ben. Oh, yes. \
**Benjamin B:** Wait, I'm \
**Joe Deng:** Ben Ben had an update from Zely that he wanted to share and so I should give him the floor now. \
**Benjamin B:** lagging. \
**Joe Deng:** Go ahead, Ben. \
**Benjamin B:** Thank you, Joe. The hand was lagging quite a bit here on Google Meets. Uh, so unfortunately, we're going to uh stop running zealy as we have done. We're not going to request more funds at the moment. So right now we are mostly trying to wrap things up and uh uh we also noticed that u we did not really have uh enough funds when AKT dropped in price. So originally we said that we were going to prioritize RO payments but uh we want to wrap things up nicely and uh promise on as much as we can. So, we're going to uh use as much of the funds as needed to wrap things up instead of paying ourselves. \

**Benjamin B:** And uh with that uh we are going to uh we're going to postpone the November contributor reward or uh contest rather if there's no objections here because there were only like four people for that contest. We're going to draw a winner today for the uh contributor winner for December. Uh we're if there's no objection and if no one has started working on logos or similar, we're going to cancel the swag contest at least for now uh until we see exactly how much we have. And uh after this uh we will probably send the rest out to payroll ourselves. We're not going to have a contest for January as well. So are there any objections or do you think this is fine everyone? Joe agrees. \
**Joe Deng:** Yeah, I just want to say that uh you know going forward Akash Club will be running a lot of those contests and events anyway. So Ben will still be involved and we'll be assisting with uh doing those activities for Akash Club. It's really just you know finishing up uh what was put out on to the community pool and so I think that this is the last month and so event is closing up and so yeah. \

**Joe Deng:** Oh, we're spinning right now. Awesome. Okay, let's go. Good luck, \
**Benjamin B:** Yeah. So this is for the uh contributor contest. So everyone who has contributed to uh you know celely website we website repo also mAkash things like that we've gathered the names from a few different sources. Uh this is for uh December and we're going to draw all of the uh SIG participant contests as time goes on. But you know, it takes time to get those merged and we only had four people the first month. So, as I said, those four will move over to the next month. Uh well, here goes nothing. Good luck. \
**Joe Deng:** Good luck, \
**Benjamin B:** and uh George Pro seems to be the winner. \
**Joe Deng:** All right. \
**Benjamin B:** Congrats. \
**Joe Deng:** And bless George. \
**Benjamin B:** Uh if we don't if we don't have your wallet address, \
**Rodri R:** if he's still lying. \
**Benjamin B:** we're going to uh ask you to send it in a DM. All right. And if there's no questions, that's it for the zealy update. \
**Joe Deng:** All right, going once. Going twice. All right, we're good. So, does anybody else have any updates for the community or any questions and whatnot? So, I'm going to open the floor one more time and uh if there's nothing left, then we'll let you guys go. I think uh 40 minutes, not bad for our first SIG community. Okay, like I said, I'll be available most of the time. So, uh, just hit me up, uh, wherever you see me. And, uh, like I said, George, I looking forward to meeting you and having our one-on-one. And we will all come back again next month. Okay. All right, guys. Sounds good. \
**Benjamin B:** All right. Thanks, \
**Joe Deng:** I'll see you later. \
