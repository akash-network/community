Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to Sig e monthly It is August 14th. 2024 much appreciate everyone's time for being here again. Usually he's meetings are run by Adam Watson ahead of community for overclock labs. Usually there's a number of insiders as well as this General community members here. I am going to be running the meeting in his absence. He should be back shortly. He's out on paternity leave. So again respecting his time.

Tyler Wright: there's a couple of items last meeting we talked about ECC we talked about Paris. We got update from Amanda and all things that happened. Excuse me out in Brussels rather.

Tyler Wright: We talked a little bit about the upcoming period and the Q3 events support proposal that went on chain and has since passed. I know we're about to get into a very very busy season where There's a number of events happening in the fall including Korea blockchain week token 2049. I'm sorry mainnets Devcon Etc. So again, it's a bit period as many of there are opportunities for

Tyler Wright: folks from the community to join and participate in support some of these conferences. There is an Akash insiders program, which people can apply to it's a program for those that want to get more involved in Akash and again development support users that are trying to get more involved join sigs and working troops groups. There's a number of Technical and non-technical ways to contribute and so a caution scientist is a program first developed by Adam to kind of be a home for those that are looking to be ambassadors and again through the Tires program there's additional opportunities for folks to get involved with in real life events hosting their own events Etc.

Tyler Wright: If anybody sees anybody in the community that wants to get more involved again, there is a page on the website where people can apply The Insider program. There is an emphasis on people inside our program that actively participate in Discord. It's hard for me to follow up with somebody or anybody that's helping out with the inside applications when that person doesn't have any activity in Discord. So just something to note for yourselves. And again people that she may come across in the community.

Tyler Wright: There are a couple of items that I wanted to make sure that we touched on as a group Amanda is actually on her way to travel to a verse event in Buenos Aires happening. I think it's a cosmo first lot. I am event both Amanda and Zach will be representing Akash looking to again collaborate with people in the ladam region continue to get more providers and on from that region as well as deployers. So again, we'll get an update from them. I probably have the next Sig community meeting and maybe prior to that the steering committee meeting. In terms of agenda items as previously mentioned there was a couple of things that I want to make sure that were covered at this event here today. There was a couple of

Tyler Wright: events that have happened Including Sachin spark hackathon that happened. There was some community pool spend that was used for that. There was a discussion fenil who I think is on the call was there are a couple other hackathons actually that are up for discussion right now, and I want to see if anybody from those discussions also here to talk to the community about their small efforts so we can get some again Community feedback beyond that when Adam wozni returns again, I want to start to prepare for what could be a working group around 2025. I think we're getting to the point where


### 00:05:00

Tyler Wright: It'd be great for folks to come together from the community to start to talk about potential events that Akash should be at in 2025 what our President should look like at these events and Beyond. So again, we'll probably create a working group in September October to cover 2025 and start to get a bench signaling proposals kind of geared up. So again, if anybody knows of any events that they think a cost should be at to be represented that please start to write those things down so that we can get those things ready for our next Sig Community call and subsequent working group.

Tyler Wright: All I do want to start with some follow-up and I'll drop in some notes from discussion again. I know that there was a hackathon where there was some and Spark hackathon. That was run by fenil who is in Akash Insider. He was also somebody that participated in the last Akash hackathon the cosathon too and So I wanted to get an update because I know there was some again community pool spend thank you very much for all that.

Ved Mohan: where I got to know about the Akash like that. I can build my product Network also, but that's a different topic. But yeah.

Ved Mohan: Not really.

Tyler Wright: Okay, and what are you looking for from the Akash team?

Tyler Wright: Okay, so have you been using a cache yourself as a event organizer?


### 00:15:00

Ved Mohan: We can surely take any person at the venue or…

Tyler Wright: Okay, is the idea that there would be included with the spot potential sponsorship there would be somebody from the Akash community that would be joining the event to provide on the ground supporter.

Ved Mohan: we can do online workshops to teach them about Akash and something like that.

Tyler Wright: How do you envision being able to support users that are asking about Akash without having built on it yourself,…

Tyler Wright: I guess.

Abhinav Gupta: Here, I'm like just doing The discus on guitar, but from some sanding some importance and actually heavy is asked for some importance link.

Tyler Wright: then what is the amount that the sponsorship?

Abhinav Gupta: my account is suspended but in the discussion, I also mentioned that we are expecting around 1000 akt it's a network tokens. So we use these tokens to provide a prizes to the parts. Sprints so doing some support in the logistic.

Tyler Wright: Okay, so the 1000 akt tokens. You said the breakdown what percentage would be broken down for?

Abhinav Gupta: Yeah, we are dividing the amount in the percentage of 40% We allocated to the price fund and…

Tyler Wright: Giving to hackers to use versus management costs. Do you have a breakdown of that?

Abhinav Gupta: 60% of the monetary support.

Tyler Wright: So for the people because again, we have no problem of there being a management cost.

Abhinav Gupta: We are covering the event Arrangements including venue logistic and…

Tyler Wright: We don't want people to be necessary working for free,…

Abhinav Gupta: supplies and…

Tyler Wright: but we want to be very clear what's going to go towards people deploying slash rewards for the project versus what's going to be going to the team that's putting on the hackathon.

Abhinav Gupta: that makes the part spent experience more better.

Ved Mohan: It was 60% 40 for the prices and 64 the other logistics menu for any other things that we have arranged for the Packers.

Abhinav Gupta: Yeah, give me a second. I'm saying that.

Tyler Wright: That would be great.

Tyler Wright: Anyone else have any questions? For Ved and the rest of the team.

Fenil Modi: Which was a platform you used for the hosting the icon therefore what?

Ved Mohan: Here for the previous one it was defolio for this one yet sequest like headquarters just started hosting hackathon. So this is their first Community hacking on also.

Fenil Modi: Okay, yeah. request

Abhinav Gupta: And we find it hack Quest it's starting so it's like providing a good features. That's why we are using that.

Fenil Modi: for my account request also a great for color presentation, but they are trying to Google update with me the else are selling their courses to our hackathon hekinom participant and that's why I said no toequest like that. I am asking why are organized on a quest platform?

Ved Mohan: Yeah, but they didn't tell us something like that because this was their first account. So they just wanted to host them and on their platform.

Fenil Modi: Okay.

Abhinav Gupta: right

Ved Mohan: Also, I guess request doesn't sell courses. They are free of cost anyone can learn about the three as far as I know and see.

Fenil Modi: Because they also reached out to meet for the heck, but all sparkly some organization request, but they're trying to save the hotel. I don't even in the forehead request and Mars Market our courses and get 1,000 decision on our courses and…

Ved Mohan: yeah.

Fenil Modi: they are asking for that way.

Abhinav Gupta: Yeah, I still like a happy link on a check.

Fenil Modi: Can you open this trailer?

Fenil Modi: second office

Abhinav Gupta: You some website. Also, I shared a defolially.

Tyler Wright: I think piyush has a great next step of because discussions are blocked. If you can just make a dock including all this information and we can continue this conversation in the Sig Community chat. That would be a great neck great next step. I do appreciate you all taking the time to join this call. I will drop this recording into Sig Community as well just for other people to weigh in just as a note because we just want to hear what the community thinks about this and the fenil proposal didn't come from community pool spend it came from different pools of money that are available. But again, we want to use this as a place for people to


### 00:25:00

Tyler Wright: Some gauge interests again. There's so many people in the community that I just wanted to get it out and open and see where the involvement just necessarily wouldn't come from community pool because it's a smaller akt request but again I do want to get the opinion of the community continue to vet this team very similar to that. We did with the spark hackathon team and then determine if this is an opportunity worth pursuing. So again bad if you all can put a conversation in a doc together in sick community, that would be very helpful. The quicker you do that the quicker will get conversation going and again we can figure out next steps from there.

Tyler Wright: any other questions on this hackathon or any other hackathons before we move on to some other topics?

Tyler Wright: All right.

Tyler Wright: Shameless plug time for again as a part of the community efforts. We're always looking for people to get involved in discussions. There are a couple of discussions that are active right now that have been active that have been created in the last couple days. I'm going to drop those in the chat. There's a couple of teams I think that some of our court team members meant out in Denver that are looking to get more involved in Akash and have talked about basically an idea that they're looking to explore so I would be great for people to get involved in these discussions. Ask critical questions. Shout out to Domi who always does a great job of doing that rodri also is active. But again, please please get involved in the discussions that goes for any Community member if anybody wants to see additional opportunities in which they see pushing their cost Network again a great sign to show

Tyler Wright: whether or not something needs community pool spend something should be actively worked on. please please feel like you should get active in those discussions at critical questions hold people accountable, but we do want to continue to use Community funds and the community pool to support the proper projects that are looking to advance that cost Network. So, please get involved in those discussions. that is also a natural segue into I know there's a specific working group for this but

Tyler Wright: There was again some time ago Robert Del Rey and Benjamin from the community from insiders talked about a developer onboarding platform. They looked at zeely. There was some initial pilot spend because it's a small dollar amount similar to some of these hackathon efforts that were provided to Robert to do initial Pilots of the developer onboarding program. There was successful in that developer onboarding program from there. There was discussions made their Roberts and Benjamin talk to the steering committee and then they put up a proposal for funds from the community pool. They got those funds in the community pool. And then Greg from the overclock Labs team also matched some of those funds the phase one and…

Robert Del Rey: Hey Tyler, Don. Thanks. And hi everybody. I believe you put it perfectly the process of having these idea and…

Tyler Wright: I proposal was successful and again that launched then creating a discussion around two phase two proposal went on chain and…

Robert Del Rey: then making it to our reality. It was exactly as you describe it we started just talking about the idea.

Tyler Wright: that proposal.

Tyler Wright: Pass on chain. And so now again we've gone through this kind of path of again discussions discussions turn into a pilot program pilot program turns into a success of that private program turns into community pool spend and…


### 00:30:00

Robert Del Rey: Then we went on and decide to do a pilot then when discussions then went on chain and the rest of the history. So yeah. We are on our way to complete week number two of the first month. It's gonna be a three month campaign.

Tyler Wright: we can continue to again use the open source framework and…

Robert Del Rey: So there is enough time for everybody to join and do the missions.

Tyler Wright: the governance to get funds.

Robert Del Rey: I actually wanted to have just one minute to say the secret word or…

Tyler Wright: Shout out to Robert and Benjamin for all the work they do I know there's a working group,…

Robert Del Rey: the community working group mission.

Tyler Wright: but I just want to see if there's anything that you want to highlight on the developers onboarding program here today for the community call.

Robert Del Rey: And The Secret World guys. I hope you're paying attention. I know you are rodri the secret word. It's gonna be Marketplace compute c o m p u t Yes, I sent an in the chat.

Tyler Wright: Thank you Again. There's zeely working group sessions. There's a Discord Channel. There's entire platform with the intention of again getting new developers from the zeely ecosystem or just new developers that are looking for specific awards for different tasks to get more involved really trying to drive Demand on the network as well as continue to find new developers that can help out with very sigs working groups Etc. So much appreciate Robert Benjamin for all their efforts. Any questions on zeely before we continue on with the agenda?

Tyler Wright: I wanted to see if there's anything else that anybody wants to talk about again with Amanda on our way to traveling towards Buenos Aires. I think we'll focus on the events at the next Sig Community call unless anybody has any objections again, I'm going to and we could talk about the next Sig Community call, but I think we're gonna make another working group that has a meeting or two for events in 2025, talking about our presentation talking about the Akash presence, talking about things that have worked and haven't worked maybe at events in 2024…

Dominikus Brian: One going to be sort of a little bit more prioritize.

Tyler Wright: what events we should be at? do we need to have more presentation?

Dominikus Brian: Do you know anything about that or?

Tyler Wright: We need to be more events,…

Dominikus Brian: in general

Tyler Wright: we can have all those discussions following our next Sig. but yeah, I just wanted to again see if there's anything else that anybody wants to talk about Community facing at this time. I think that's a community question. I think that's a great question. If you want to hear my answer, I believe that it should be demand. I believe that once you solve the problem of demand then there's going to be a whole bunch of Supply that is we know is sitting idle that is going to be spun up very quickly. So for me, I'm always interested in teams and individuals that are building products that as they grow. Go ahead Their usage of the Akash Network grows. So, we've seen a bunch of companies AI space But even from a workflow standpoint, I won't say that traditional Cloud, but

Tyler Wright: 

Tyler Wright: again, there are clouds that benefit from demand side of a Netflix using their product as Netflix has more users Netflix has more as their product grows their need to use

Tyler Wright: Said Central Cloud could grows. I think from a cautious side. That's when you'll continue to adoption and continue to growth on the supply side is when there's so many projects are looking for gpus resources looking for any sort of competing compute resources and it's an easy self for overclock Labs easy sell for people in the community to be like, you have CPUs or you should bring them on because you will make money tomorrow because there's so much demand for it. As you mentioned I think both sides of the marketplace are going to be important, but my vote would be demand and I'll talk a little bit more about that to your point. Don't me? I think another thing to think about is we've

Tyler Wright: As a cost Community, I've spent some time thinking about the web three ecosystem and then we think about when it's a time to focus a little bit more on to developers web to ecosystem. When is that right time to go to some more web to conferences? So continuing to think about that where our presence is most valuable and…

Dominikus Brian: Great totally agree.

Tyler Wright: web 3 where it's most valuable and around the deep in narrative, how that ties into web 3, or maybe we need to be doing kubernetes conferences more traditional web 2 conferences and thinking about those questions holistically and more specifically what events we should be at would be great things to start thinking about

Tyler Wright: any other topics that anybody wants to discuss that haven't been discussed.

Tyler Wright: look out for some announcements over and next week or two. There's gonna be some opportunities for people in the community to get involved in testnet for Cosmos 47 or customers. That's okay 47. It's not like an incentivized test net like we've done previously where there's a bunch of people that can come in you can get rewards but we are looking for technical folks validators providers just general people that can work with the CLI work with consoles to help with testing. There are some incentives that are going to be from overclock labs to help with the testing to help the core engineering but again,

Tyler Wright: It's not going to be centiv testing it has been incentivized testing it has been traditionally but we do need some Hands-On deck. So look out for announcements there again, the schedule of the next couple weeks will get truncated. Next Thursday will be the steering committee because as you all know September is going to be extremely busy from an event standpoint with career blockchain at the beginning of the month Masari maintenance in the middle of the month talking 249 at the end of the month and then a whole bunch of other events happening into October and Beyond actually, I'm sorry. I mean it might be at the end of the month as well. So just a whole lot going on that's again that core team and members of the community will all be active out. So yeah, and then again, there's also potential opportunities for a hackathon in the beginning of September other hackathon opportunities. So there's a whole lot going on among some console up.

Tyler Wright: It's core product updates. So, please look out for updates. Please get involved in discussions. There's several couple of really good interesting discussions again one. I'll drop in the chat discussion 656 from a technical team that I have. Connected with so please get involved in this discussion ask critical questions…

Ved Mohan: Yeah sure that.

Tyler Wright: because again continuing to drive demand is on everyone's mind and some of these teams might have in front of mine, but they're always looking for on people that get involved in discussions.

Tyler Wright: All right, if there's nothing else then I'll certainly let you all go a couple minutes early.

Robert Del Rey: Right. Thanks guys. Stay safe everybody.

Tyler Wright: But again much appreciate the conversation around hackathons around events, please Ved get involved create that document that doc so we can continue that conversation in the Sig Community Discord Channel and…

Rodri R: today

Tyler Wright: look to get something figured out sometime soon.

Tyler Wright: much appreciate everyone's time today again great conversations. As always. Hopefully Adam will be back next time we meet so you don't have to deal with me anymore. But again, it has been a pleasure to be here in Adams absence. Thank you all very much. See you all in the metaverse.
