## **Transcript**

Damir Simpovic: Sir.

Adam Wozney: Hello.

Adam Wozney: Ops. All right, let me make my announcement in the SIG community channel. How's everybody doing on this lovely Lovely Wednesday, I guess. No, it's Tuesday. my god, I'm really out of it.  Sig community. Okay. Oops. Go. let Pablo in. All right. Cool.

Adam Wozney: I think we got a nice crew of people here. Let me pull up my notes. All right, one more person. Excellent. We'll get another minute here. a life. Am I What a life. I'm wearing this cool new shirt that I got. You like the color? What do you think of the Good color. It's like Kind of like a mint Luna, get you in here. All right.

Adam Wozney: I actually bought this specifically for Burning Man, but that's not what we're here to talk about. All right, let me it is Great. It's been recording this whole thing. I didn't mean to talk about Burning Welcome everyone to the SIG community monthly call on the 13th of May, 2025. Thank you guys for joining as always. I have a very short and fun agenda here today. I want to get your guys' thoughts and feedback on a handful of items. give some programming and activities updates and see what other things come up. But before we get into any of that, are there any agenda items that you guys want to make sure we cover or bring up in today's SIG community call?

Adam Wozney: Speak now or forever hold your tongue once, twice. All right, we'll get right into it. So, as a reminder, the SIG community call is for discussing talking about support and management of Akos community initiatives. most of which have come through the governance proposal that we put together at the beginning of the year and we put out quarterly.  But there are a handful of other community activities that are taking place or underway that are outside of those gov props. I wanted to kick it off with talking about the goat crop initiatives and kind of giving some updates on how those things are progressing and then talk about a few other activities that are underway currently. first up on the community program side. So as a part of our go for community programs are four programs that are currently launched live and going.

Adam Wozney: All of which are going really well, which I'll be giving you guys updates on here shortly. First one is the Vanguards. So, just as an update, Vanguards are individuals in the community that help support technical questions and non-technical questions on Discord or Telegram or various other places. currently we're doing a monthly feedback form from the Vanguards where they highlight specific issues that the community is focused on, thinking about. so I wanted to share that real quick here. Let me bust this window open. So this is April's feedback. you can see some data in regards to specific items within Akos that need to be addressed or just need to be highlighted. You can see that it's kind of hard to read. I'm actually going to circle. You can't really read what this says.

Adam Wozney: We do have access to the full question for each of these but you can get a pretty high level and I'm just going to focus on high level the main support themes for the month. So Vanguards are reporting that in April the main support theme were around console issues. what does that mean? we're kind of getting a little bit more granular within certain aspects of some of these kind of top level themes. we created some new questions this month that you can see So within console you can see there's these granular issues will be run up the flag pole and shared with not just OCL but with other members of the community in various Sega calls. and you can see here console not loading, timing out or error messaging or logs. So those things are useful to know and to track so it can constantly improve the AOS console.


### 00:05:00

Adam Wozney: all of this data is actually shared with the insider community and with various members of the OUCL team that are working on core contributions to AOS. So all this data is super useful. high level for the Vanguards is this type of information goes a very long way in just making the Kosh network a better place. So I would say the Vanguards is a very important aspect of the community. one of the most important things here is level of satisfaction from our users. And you can see are very satisfied, 40% are satisfied. If whatever gets into the territory where it's neutral or dissatisfied, that's when we'll have to say, okay, what do we need to do to improve it, but so far things have been good. It has tracked down month over month. So, if you go into March, here's Marches. it's the exact same. Never mind. Let's see. February. This is a little bit older.

Adam Wozney: satisfaction level 6040. So it really hasn't changed over month. So this is really just interesting data to track over time. If this number changes, from February to March to April and now in May, something we'll want to pay attention to. Another one is just technical questions people are answering per day. And of the 10 Vanguards that we have currently, they're answering one to five questions per day, which I think is a good number.  And if you go, track March March numbers, it's about the same one to five 70% and then in February 80% 1 to5. So it has gone down. so people are answering a little more questions, which I think is a good thing.

Adam Wozney: If it ever gets to the point where, technical questions are, people are answering 11 to 15 per day and a majority of the community is answering that in the Vanguards program, then we might say, we might want to board some or onboard some new Vanguards because we want to make sure that the support given is in a timely fashion. and we have a general number of within 24 hours to get some of those questions answered from our Discord page.  So top level for the Vanguard's program. Everything is going very well. So thanks for everyone supporting that. Next on the agenda is the ring masters program. So currently we have around five or six ring masters that are pretty active in regards to hosting regular AOS events. In April they held five events across the world.

Adam Wozney: mostly right now focused in India and Nigeria, but we do have some folks in Sweden, some folks in Spain, and in Ukraine that are starting to host events. You can see all of the different activities from our community events program in our Luma page. So, here are the current list of events that are taking place around the world. We have a series going on in Nigeria and then, of course, a big one is AOS Accelerate, which is coming up on June 23rd in New York. you can see all the past events on our Luma page and here's where you can really see the full scope of just how many events are actively taking place. We're averaging, almost one Meetup event per week, which I think is awesome. always looking to onboard some new ring masters. We do have budget for that. I'm using some of that budget for some watch parties that are specific to Accelerate, which are happening the same day as Accelerate.

Adam Wozney: I think currently we have watch parties in Ukraine, India, Nigeria, the US, Spain and I think potentially Germany and watch parties will be live streamed videos of the AOS accelerate which is happening in June. So I'm excited about that. So overall we're averaging one to two meetup events per week as a part of this program. in April we had those five events and we had over 700 attendees. So those are all people that didn't know about a KOS and now they're learning about Ring Masters program is going very well. navigators. So the navigators program just so you guys are up to speed. It's essentially a business development and I guess you could say sales team from the community.

Adam Wozney: They work with projects that need access to Akos resources and help them onboard from discovery calls to technical architecture to deployments and everything in between. it's all community run and owned. Currently there's 11 deals that are in the pipeline right now helping onboard new clients into the AOS network. We kind of split the navigators into multiple categories but at a high level there's senior navigators. those folks are paid full-time to help onboard individuals. They're either non-technical. you can think of it as a traditional sales pipeline. People raise their hand saying, "Hey, I want to get access to GPUs or CPUs or Macos resources. A BD navigator will connect with them. there's technical questions, they'll plug them into an integrations navigator. Those are the more technical individuals. and then they help them all along the path.


### 00:10:00

Adam Wozney: We do also have junior navigators and I'm actually rethinking what junior navigators look like. Initially it was like if you able to help out or you want to bring some folks in just plug them in and it was a little bit messy. There's no real kind of strategy. So I think what I'm going to do is we're going to keep the senior navigators who are paid for their work. that's not changing but junior navigators I think I'm going to look at them as more of kind of a lead generation.  So if a junior navigator actually finds a project, they get plugged into the pipeline and they deploy, they'll get rewarded with AKT for those projects that they find and they get plugged in and they actually deploy. So I think we'll be able to find new leads. This way we'll get more projects into the Akash network, which I think is beneficial.

Adam Wozney: So over the next few weeks, I'll be updating the junior navigator kind of portion of the navigators program. But so far, it's been really successful. being able to have community members that are actively working with individuals and projects and helping them deploy into AOS, that's beneficial long term because it just makes a more useful and beneficial for anyone that's involved. So, navigators program, good. what I've been spending a lot of my time on and the community's been spending a lot of our time on over the past few months and specifically over the past couple weeks is Akos edu and this is the Alchemists are community members who develop content educational content to teach people about Akos.

Adam Wozney: we've been using Omnaflex up until this point to host the courses and now I think we're at a stage where we need quicker access and better access to data on what is happening within Akos edu. So I'm experimenting with a new platform. I actually need to talk to the Omniflex guys and let them know that we're going to be using this platform for the interim until we kind of see how things progress.  But I'm going to give you guys you're getting the firsthand access to what this new platform looks like. So let me share my screen here. So this is the new website for akos edu. currently we have four courses that were community developed that we're going to be launching. they're all very beginner courses like what is decentralization, what is aos.

Adam Wozney: pretty high level stuff, but we want the beginner courses first and then we can kind of get more into the weeds and intermediate courses, but this is where people will go. It gives you a very high level of what au is these graphics I want to call out. These were community develop graphics. so I think they look pretty sharp. I'm happy about that. you can see a couple of the instructors. I need to add one more, but these are a few Kosh insiders and community members who've developed these courses.  And then people can click enroll. It will take them to your courses. You'll click start course. You can see everything's very seamless. and then you see here all the new courses that will be live. So each course has three sections. One is like a prerequisites doc. It's like here's what you need to know.

Adam Wozney: One is a video where there's a demo and a baseline kind of teaching of what those individual courses are about and then each of these courses were community developed. and I'm really excited. I just think this platform is really seamless. We're going to be able to track better how many people have completed each course. so I'm really excited about this. So you guys are getting a firsthand vantage point into what this new curriculum will look like.  So that we're going to be testing. it's not completed yet. The rough that's the V1 of what you're seeing, but the next stage is sharing this with the insiders who are kind of our top tier community members. Sharing this with members of Overclock Labs, getting their feedback, making sure that everything's working, making sure all the ether crossed, eyed or dotted.


### 00:15:00

Adam Wozney: And my goal is that by our next community SIG call, we'll actually have some data on who's been going through the courses, how it's been going, and then maybe even talking about the next wave of courses that we can create for this. I'm really excited about Akash edu. So, that's a big one. So, I wanted to call out the alchemist work on Akashedu. That's it for the four programs currently. Any questions on any of those four programs and where things lie? Ben, go for it.

Benjamin B: Hi, Adam. I have one question and that's about the navigators program.

Adam Wozney: Yes. No,…

Benjamin B: You mentioned that the navigators will mostly just be finding leads. will there still be a road to become a senior navigator or is that being scrapped?

Adam Wozney: no. Yeah, I got you. so how I'm thinking about it is currently we have I believe four or five kind of full-time senior navigators and they work with clients. they're a part of the pipeline going from discovery call to integration to architecture to deployment to it's closed and their projects fully deployed. Those folks work with clients from beginning to end. and they're the ones that actually get paid as a part of the program.  Junior navigators currently are unpaid. currently we have it set up where junior navigators, we can kind of reach out to them if there's potential for the need for a full-time paid role as a navigator. but in terms of the work that junior navigators do, we really don't have a framework for it. So, the way I'm thinking about it is senior navigators will remain the same. Whenever a lead comes in, they'll actually sus it out.

Adam Wozney: They'll define, parameters for working with these individuals. They'll help deploy. That's not changing. The junior navigator role, I think, is going to change where if, let's say, I go to an event and I come into contact with a project that needs access to, 10 GPUs or 100 GPUs, which would be great. Junior Navigators will define who these projects are.  They'll introduce these projects to the pipeline where they'll hand it over to the senior navigators to start working with. If that project goes from discovery call to implementation to deployment, junior navigators will get rewarded with AKT. It's still defining exactly what the incentive structure total cost will be and budget for that. But that's how I'm thinking about it. If the navigators program wow, there's a lot of incoming leads.

Adam Wozney: is a lot of help that we need. We'll look to the junior navigators who at that stage you would assume have been introducing clients or potential clients to the senior navigators. We'll say okay these people seem like they are ready to go. Are you interested in being a senior navigator? And then they'll say yes or no and we'll onboard them. That's kind of how I'm seeing this process work. Does that make sense?

Benjamin B: Yeah, I really liked the process of that.

Benjamin B: I think it all makes sense.

Adam Wozney: Okay, cool.

Adam Wozney: Yeah, so I'm working on the framework for it. Give me a little time. There's a bunch of other things that are on my plate, but I would say over the next couple days, weeks here, I'll be launching that within the Junior Navigators channel and Discord.  And for anybody watching this recording or who's not an insider, the only way you gain access to any four of those programs that I mentioned is if you apply and you become an insider. So just wanted to call that Any other questions on the four community programs. All right. Next up is this is also part of the governance proposals that we put out are community activities.  And we have three community activities that are kind of listed in this hackathons, contributions, and community events. I'll go first with the ones that there has been no traction on. Community events.

Adam Wozney: Community events are basically when Akos goes to a conference, reaching out to local community leaders within crypto or AI and trying to host an event with them, getting in with those community leaders and then trying to get them to onboard into the Akash network as an insider, as a ring master, as someone that can actually contribute to AOSH on a more regular basis. To be honest, just haven't at any time to focus on finding those individuals at events that we go to. so ultimately if we don't do the community events budget, it just goes right back into the community pool. no big deal. So currently community events, not a lot happening there. On the hackathon side, the budget that we put together were for owned hackathons and for sponsored hackathons. We have sponsored a few hackathons that I will be sharing some data on probably in our next SIG community call.


### 00:20:00

Adam Wozney: they're communityowned hackathons where we sponsored them at a very low cost and I can share some of that data as soon as I get some more of that stuff and put some of that stuff together. But other than that, we're not really being proactive with hackathons, meaning we're not really planning on an own hackathon right now. We're not really planning on any sponsored hackathons currently. mostly because of all the things that I just discussed. There's a lot of activities happening in a lot of other places.  So we're trying to knock those things out before we move on to the next kind of community activity. So on the community event side and the hackathon side, not a lot happening there. But on the contribution side, we are doing community contributions. And I'll put this in the chat if you guys want to check it out.

Adam Wozney: So, we're working with one of our Akos insiders who has a background in community contributions and bounties programs and they've actually put together a framework to help better support individuals that want to contribute code, want to update our documents, anything that you can think of that would just make it easier for people to deploy and do things on Akos. She's actually focused on creating a framework for that. Nothing's changing in terms of the open source nature of Akos.  If somebody wants to go and contribute, they can just go into GitHub. They can respond to, an issue. They can do whatever they want. Absolutely. Think of this as more of a white glove service for people that maybe don't know exactly how to start contributing. They'll basically put in their information. the comm contributions manager will reach out to them and they'll actually work with them helping them define, here's something you can work on, here's something you can do. So, there's still really two ways to contribute.

Adam Wozney: One is just a manual way where you go into the Akos GitHub and start searching around and jumping into the discord seeing how you want to contribute or if you're looking for a little bit more handholding if you need help figuring out how can I exactly get involved the contributions manager is there to kind of support So that's a new program. I'm still getting data on how many contributions have come in through that program but I think in our next comm s monthly call for community I'll have some data on we've had this many people apply this many people have contributed here's how what the outcomes of those contributions are and what they will be so I'm really excited about that but we're still kind of putting the finishing touches on that program because that really only launched about a month ago so

Adam Wozney: That's it Any questions on any of those three community activities? No. All right. only a couple other items I want to bring up before we can open up for discussion from you guys is we have two new requirements for the insiders community program. one is filling out a feedback form, which is a monthly thing, and one is attending a special interest group call just like from that feedback form that we put out for February and March, insiders actually listed a handful of opportunities and interests that they would want to potentially get involved in. So, we started some conversations in Discord specifically for the insider community to discuss development of new community initiatives.

Adam Wozney: of that feedback there's five things that came out. One is regional leads basically people managing kind of areas of the world helping on board new users hosting events plugging into community programs at universities potential grants a bunch of different things. So those people would lead kind of regional areas and it actually helped onboard maybe new insiders to kind of manage in the city level.  So, think of it as almost like a traditional community team where there's a regional lead, then there's city leads, and everything kind of funnels up to this global initiative. So, I've been spending a lot of time on kind of the framework for what that regional leads program looks like. We have a kickoff call tomorrow for insiders that are interested in participating and what that can be, but it's still very much under development. So, that's one program. Another is a mentorship program that is still very much under the works.

Adam Wozney: We're kind of putting together a framework of what a mentorship program looks like at a navigators might plug into the vanguards. So that all needs to be discussed and defined but high level is like helping individual users mentoring them getting them up to speed on what they can do with the AOS network. The next one is grants. This is something we've done in the past where we actually fund projects that are beneficial to Akos. still putting the framework on that still thinking through what that looks like but again that is an insider activity the one that I have been spending some time on besides regional leads is community engagement so if you go to discord you go to twitter you go to all these different telegram there's a lot of community activities that happen on various project for various projects a lot of them are contest related which I don't love but that doesn't mean that we can't do something like that so the engagement initiative is working with community members that are part of the insiders


### 00:25:00

Adam Wozney: program to define what are some community engagement activities that we can do that will make our discord more sticky introduce more people to Akos in a meaningful way. So not just contests not just gamified things but what are the things that we can do to kind of get more people involved in Akos and having the community kind of lead those initiatives.  So I have a kickoff call for that program tomorrow as and again that is open just for insider community members. And then the final one is student programs and this is basically getting plugged into universities blockchain organizations or professors that teach AI or crypto within different university programs.

Adam Wozney: So, still putting the framework around what that looks like, but I think those five programs will be developed over the next few weeks, months, and hopefully we can actually start launching some of these things once we get a few of those other items that I've just discussed earlier off of our plates. So, those are five new kind of activities that have been highlighted by insiders that they're interested in getting involved in. the big two are regional lead and engagement.  Once we get those knocked out, then I think we can work on student programs, grants, and mentorship. and I think these all kind of plug into each other, which is really nice. So, give us some time. I think we'll have some updates on that in the future Any questions on those insider activity programs? Nope. next up very briefly is events.

Adam Wozney: So currently Amanda who heads up events for Akos is focused on Akos Accelerate which is happening in June in New York. this is going to be a very big event. It's our second annual Akos Accelerate. really excited for this. It will be live streamed. So I think we will be doing a few watch parties around the world that kos ring masters are if anyone's interested in hosting a watch party, just head over to the Discord, let us know in one of those chats and we can try to plug you in. But she's been spending a lot of time on permissionless is coming up which is happening right after a G accelerate in New York. So, we'll be attending that's another one that was on the agenda that she's working on. And then another one is Mint, which is happening in Singapore. And I actually don't know too much about the Mint conference, but I'm sure she'll be sharing more on that in the future.

Adam Wozney: So, a lot of event related activities. If you're interested in learning about what we're doing in terms of events, just head over to the AOS website and click on events and you can check that out. Any questions on events? No. All right. one quick update that I'm just going to share with you guys. I'm g share my screen. Let me share this. One second, Ben, and then I'll get to you here.  So on the AOSH website, this is a new page that was just added. So if you go to the community page, you can see all these different activities, different things that are going on. we added a welcome page. And this is basically because before you'd go over to community and there was just events, insiders, validators, some people would click on community, but it wouldn't do anything. So if you actually click on community, it goes to a welcome page. And this is a new page that was just launched.

Adam Wozney: basically just kind of lists out very quick highlevel things that people can get involved in within the community. So there's insiders program community contributions which we We just talked about all the events that we're participating in. you can review community contributions in GitHub and this is basically the two different ways that you can contribute.  one is just learn on your own and kind of manually search GitHub or you can actually sign up and kind of get some white club service in terms of how you'd like to contribute and then Akos edu which links to our old edu page which we should be updating soon and then it just lists out some of our support channels here as well or social channels as well. So that's a new website web page just wanted to call out really happy with how that looked Ben go for it.

Benjamin B: Yeah. one thing about the events part for permission as Amanda mentioned in the group chat that no insiders will be attending at least not …

Benjamin B: be is anyone from Overcooked Labs going to attend or is it just me right now?

Adam Wozney: So, I know Greg has a talk there.

Adam Wozney: I know we don't have a booth this year. I will be in New York and I know the folks at Permissionless, so I'll be attending as well. I think Amanda and Zach may go, but I don't know if they have tickets.  So, I think right now the only people I know from Overclock going for sure are me, Amanda, and Greg, but I don't know if there's anyone else going because we don't have a booth. We're sponsoring it, so we're just putting our name on there. So, there isn't really like a need for r community support on site. So, that's probably why we don't have any insiders going to that one or paid insiders going to that one.


### 00:30:00

Benjamin B: All right,…

Benjamin B: got it. Then at least I won't be alone from the AOS community there.

Adam Wozney: No, no,…

Adam Wozney: you definitely won't be. And I might launch a channel in the Discord. And this is just for folks listening in. We do have an AOS events category where we showcase regional events, accelerate, and then I have a private channel for the Accelerate watch parties that I'm planning with some of the insiders. Because we're sponsoring permissionless, I might add a category there.  So, if there is anyone in the community that's attending, it might be worth jumping in there and kind of getting Cool.

Adam Wozney: next up, so just I'm just going to highlight and maybe pose this question to the community before we open it up for just general discussion is I was using a program called Talkbase to kind of measure and track community activity across Discord, GitHub, and Aluma. It was really great because let's say Democus signed up for Akos Accelerate.  he is active on our Discord and he's contributed to GitHub. It actually links that one user into one account where you can see all of their activity. And that was super useful for me because I could reach out to community members and say, "Hey, you're super involved. you want to get plugged in. Can I answer any questions?" it's also good just to track data over time, like how the community abs and flows, like users joining, new users leaving. So, it was a really good thing to track, but talk is going away sadly.

Adam Wozney: I used to use this thing called Orbit. That's gone away. There's not a lot of community aggregation tools that I'm familiar with or that are available where you can plug in all these different community kind of products into one place where you can see how the overall community is doing. There are some bots on Discord that are useful. But if anyone here is familiar with any community aggregation tools, hit me up on Discord.  I am looking to find ways to better support community initiatives and having a tool like this to track metrics is super useful. So, I'm pretty bummed that talk base is going away. So, if you guys know of any, just hit me up on Discord. So, I just wanted to call that out. that's it for my agenda. Do you guys have any questions on anything I talked about? Any things you wanted to bring up or highlight? Any supports or thoughts on anything at all? Speak now or forever hold your peace.

Adam Wozney: All right, I guess You guys don't have much to say. That's fine with me. I get to go get lunch now because I'm starving. as always, if you guys have any questions, concerns, comments, anything at all, head over to the Discord, head over to the SIG community channel there. that's all I got. I want to thank you guys for joining this month's SIG community call.  And as always, we'll see you in the metaverse. Later, everybody.
