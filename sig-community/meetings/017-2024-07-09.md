Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to Sig Community monthly meeting number 17. It is June or student July 9th. 2024. Usually The Specialist Group for Community is run by Adam wasley is currently out on paternity leave. So while he's out, I will be supporting and helping to run these meetings at the last.

Tyler Wright: Sig community meeting the group talked about a number of topics including Q3 events proposal which I believe just passed on chains last week. I'm so thank you to all those that voted on that proposal again. It has passed I'll drop a link in chat for those as well as the Community Support proposal that has also passed on chain. So again, if anybody thank you to all the voted again and that'll just help continue some of those programs moving forward Q3 and then again, there'll be another proposal going on.

Tyler Wright: We also talked about ECC a bit a number of folks that usually this call are currently out on the ground in Brussels again akashes hosting or participating and I think over 14 events including the main ECC event in a couple other larger events or happening in Brussels as well. So there's a large presence in Brussels. I believe Greg has a number of talks as well as a Neil the head of product and VP of engineering at the number of talks happening in Brussels. So the whole slate of events, I'm sure we'll talk about those in more detail during the steering committee. But if anybody has any additional questions again following those events, feel free to drop those in Sig community.

Tyler Wright: again, just as a reminder, there's an action item from the last Sig Community monthly meeting around getting folks to participate in any events that they have upcoming for Q3 or Q4. We're also started to put together again. I'm sure a working group around the 2025 events. again look after that over next couple of months, but if folks can start to put together events that they see or getting notified about that would be very helpful to the Greater Community to start to and do some initial planning.

Tyler Wright: on top of that again this proposals that passed on chain number 260 and 259 the Q3 Community Support proposal. I will drop those in the chat for folks just as a reference points if they don't already have it one additional item that was discussed at Sig economics, but it's a newer item is just from a transparency sake again anything that is currently being managed by overclock. When we ask that all groups do this. There is a

Tyler Wright: A public reporting dashboard that's available to folks. It's called community pool spend reporting. I'll drop it in the chapter folks, but it's just another reference point. I know Huey has traditionally put all transparent reporting for all past events inside the specific GitHub discussions. But now there is again a reporting board for those that want to understand how funds are spent from some of these proposals out of news community pool spend. So again, if anybody has any questions or comments, feel free to drop those in sick Community, but again also reports are available to larger community.

Tyler Wright: cool related to the Community Support proposal again one of the things that we try to do with insiders as well as just general members of the community is activate contributions from everywhere to get to the Cloud parody and to continue to build their caution Network that it takes more than

Tyler Wright: Just a few individuals and teams again. Overclock Labs is just one of the many teams that it's working on the acost network open source project with that said there are a number of bounties opportunities for folks that want to get involved. It's a bounty board that I'll drop a link in the chat but there's also a bounty hunter's area on Discord where again if folks as get involved there they can also again get access or it had the Insiders connect them to some of the items and then I can see where they can contribute I would also ask insiders to again if they can join The Specialist Group are working group to do so because that send individuals are looking to contribute to one of those groups that is a great way and easy way to get involved where people can just get to know you during a meeting. Even if you don't have much just saying just listening we can introd

00:05:00

Tyler Wright: Yourself and then here live about things that are being worked on and figure out where you can add value. So I'll continue to ask insiders to push that as well. But if there's another opportunity that you see looking to get involved again, please feel free to reach out. There's both non-technical and Technical ways to get involved.

Tyler Wright: very quickly and I want to open up to see if there's anybody else that has any agenda items. I know at the last meeting also talked about the development platform Robert gave us an update on. some of the work that he's been doing along with Fiverr for zealy. And so maybe we can get update there. The only other items that I wanted to cover today were around hackathons we talked about last week. there are a couple of hackathon opportunities as a quadratic funding opportunity from door hacks that they've pitch to us following their cost hackathon that just ended in end of May. There's also a small hackathon where they put a proposal on chain.

Tyler Wright: And there was some hackathon funds available. because there's no hack upon happening over the summer, and it's a small dollar amount and remember the community and remember the Insiders available to go in person. We're backing this hackathon. So again, I'll drop in information for that hackathon there. But again, this is something that has been paid and again shared for folks.

Tyler Wright: So again, if anybody has any other small hackathon opportunities that you see over the next couple of months, especially while Adam is out. Please feel free to send them the drop a note in Sig Community get folks involved in the discussion. I know there are some again Akash hackathon, akt available based upon a proposal. I went out the top of the year. So again, we're I think the ideas to save a large portion of those funds for a fall or winter hackathon. I'll be run by Adam and members of the community but leading up to that again if there's any small opportunities that you see to try to drive Demand with new users or existing users that leverage it costs compute again, feel free to drop a note in sick community and we can look to support those hackathons. You can start a discussion similarly to what

Tyler Wright: that team spark hackathon did or again. You can just start a discussion in Discord and then see where it leads from there.

Tyler Wright: all Other than that, the only other item I was going to touch on was this General Discord. We take some time during the six support to talk about this in detail as well. But I know that some members of insiders have called out some spam activity that they've seen and some scams that they've seen leveraging certain words like server announcement Etc. If anybody from the larger Community or Insider specifically see any beams in terms of

00:10:00

Tyler Wright: content or words that should be caught by an Autobot tool, to cut down on scamming and spam and the cost Network Discord server. Feel free to drop those in Sig Community. or if you're an Insider and The Insider Channel again, we'll use time during this sick Community call to just checking on just general scamming and spam inside Discord and make sure that we can continue to monitor it and remove it as often as we can. Any other terms or any other behaviors that anybody here is seen in the Discord or other channels that might be worth sharing.

Tyler Wright: Go ahead.

Rodri R: Why do people want to do with that? Because it happened more now.

Tyler Wright: yeah, I say that's a good call. Rodri we can do if you can continue to reach out to people let them know I will do that as well because I think I know some of the folks that you're talking about. That's actually a good call out one of the things that we're trying to do and we talked about this in six support meeting is as new people join. The Discord many folks are because of the growth of the cash Network project over the last few years. There's a number of people that want to by themselves to the cache of our actual functioning web 3 projects that works and has utility. and so they just look for partnership opportunities that are

Tyler Wright: Kind of just a waste of time and energy. What we've asked folks to do inside especially is start to ask some specific questions to funnel out some of these General inquiries that come in through Discord. So, if they don't say what kind of organization they're from or what kind of partnership they're looking to have, asking those specific information from pieces of information in the public to try to again get more information out of them or feel throughout some of the people are just looking to spam the Discord and I'm never looking to come back. That's a great way to again. That's some of these opportunities prior to tagging a From there. Again. The member of the core team will be looking but you always look to.

Tyler Wright: have an Insider reach out to remember the core team if there's an opportunity that makes sense. But again, this is an open community. So anybody from the community can get involved and kind of pushing these hope opportunities forward and assessing what next steps need to be done. So I will continue to reiterate that to folks and I'll ask insiders or anybody listening to this call to be a steward and again help push newer folks in the right direction and get as much information out of them as possible.

00:15:00

Tyler Wright: thank you Roger for calling about

We have folks talk about those ideas and Discord and then during some of the sigm working groups and also in GitHub discussions are some active discussions going on.
