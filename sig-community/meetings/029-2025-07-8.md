## Meeting Notes

### Vanguard Program
- Vanguards continue to handle 1–5 technical support questions daily across Discord, Telegram, and Reddit.
- Response time remains under 1–2 hours, showing strong community support performance.
- The current team of 10 Vanguards has remained stable for 6–12 months.
- 100% user satisfaction was recorded in the latest monthly feedback report—an all-time high.
- If activity increases, the team will expand.

### Ring Masters Program
- 37 total events were hosted in Q2, including 12 watch parties during Akash Accelerate.
- Adjusted for Accelerate, 25 unique events still mark significant growth from Q1 (16 events).
- Q3 projections show ~27 events planned.
- Over 2,700 RSVPs were recorded across events, indicating strong onboarding and outreach.
- Majority of events are happening in India and Nigeria; aim to diversify geographically.

### Navigators Program
- Focused on onboarding clients with larger GPU needs (10+).
- Currently has 3 navigators managing a growing pipeline of prospective projects.
- Supports end-to-end integration: tech stack planning, deployment, and ongoing support.
- Considered no longer a pilot, but still evolving as a program.

### Alchemists Program & Akash EDU
- Alchemists are creating educational content for the Akash EDU platform.
- Five beginner courses launched; four more in production to complete a 9-course series.
- Akash 105 (Mastering Provider Console) was launched last week.
- 60+ sign-ups so far, ~25% course completion rate without external promotion.
- Intermediate and advanced courses are being planned, with content to be reviewed by OCL and insiders.
- Promotional campaigns for Akash EDU will launch once the beginner courses are complete.

### Regional Leads Program
- New program introduced to scale Akash adoption regionally with dedicated community managers.
- Role includes:
  - Application process with questions on candidate background, local ecosystem, and strategic plans.
  - Screening interview and technical understanding assessment by Vanguards.
  - Creation of 3-month OKRs based on local objectives.
  - Monthly performance reviews and potential for renewal based on goal completion.
- Program budget supports 4 regional leads during this 6-month pilot phase (July–December).
- Open only to Akash Insiders.
- Role is higher-paying but not full-time; includes funding flexibility for events, outreach, and ecosystem support.
- City Leads may be onboarded under Regional Leads to extend reach and reduce bottlenecks.
- Each region will define tailored KPIs, while maintaining global program standards.

### Community Activities & Budget Allocation Updates

#### Hackathons & Conferences
- Budget updated to focus on event sponsorships proposed by insiders.
- Priority will be insider-led participation in meaningful local events (e.g., AI-focused hackathons).
- Sponsorship decisions will be fast-tracked if pitched in SIG community meetings or Discord.
- Travel expenses not covered—only sponsorships and direct event contributions.
- Community members are encouraged to identify and pitch local/regional events.

#### Community Events Budget
- Shifted from sponsoring third-party local meetups to sending insiders to strategic external events.
- Emphasis on events not already covered by Amanda’s major event proposals (e.g., DevCon).
- Goal is to increase insider connectivity, ecosystem awareness, and real-world representation.
- Encourages post-event reporting: impact metrics, community engagement, onboarding outcomes.

#### Community Bounties / Contributions
- Q3 marks the official ramp-up of the bounty/contribution program.
- Includes structured negotiation, support, and tracking of contributor output.
- Proposal renamed to "Community Contributions" to better reflect purpose and scope.

### Event Updates
- Akash Accelerate concluded successfully with high watch party engagement.
- Amanda is now focused on:
  - **ICML (Toronto)** and **NeurIPS (San Diego)**—both AI and ML events.
  - Planning smaller community meetups in **San Francisco** and **New York**.

### Q&A and Participant Suggestions

#### Andrew Gnatyuk
- Raised multiple points and suggestions:
  - Clarified that regional leads must be technically knowledgeable and marketing-capable.
  - Asked whether additional funding for activities can come from the community pool—answer: case-by-case.
  - Suggested applicants submit a 3-month proposal plan with measurable milestones—confirmed as part of the application.
  - Inquired about funding for city leads—tentatively supported as part of Regional Leads' OKRs.
  - Emphasized the importance of **recaps and performance summaries** from funded events.
    - Adam supported the idea and advised tagging Amanda in the Events WG for quarterly reports.

#### Rodri R
- Asked about Akash’s participation in Cosmoverse.
  - Adam advised reaching out to Amanda for updates on potential sponsorship or presence.

## Action Items
- **Adam Wozney** to finalize and share the Regional Leads application and OKR templates.
- **All participants** to promote and participate in voting on the currently live Programs Proposal and upcoming Activities Proposal.
- **Community Members** to propose hackathon and event sponsorships through Discord and future SIG calls.
- **Interested insiders** to apply for the Regional Leads Program once applications open.
- **Amanda Keay** (via Events WG) to follow up on Cosmoverse sponsorship plans and provide quarterly event recaps.



## **Transcript**

Adam Wozney: GM GM GM.

Amanda Keay: GM.

Adam Wozney: Can I make an announcement in the SIG community channel? We're kicking off.

Adam Wozney: Okay. All right.

Adam Wozney: All right, got another minute here for other folks to join. Hope everyone's having a wonderful Taco Tuesday. Getting a fill of tacos for lunch, dinner, or even breakfast tacos. What the heck? We're going to kick it off here in couple short seconds. Just getting some more people in the door. there's another person. Get my notes open.  Got a handful of things to discuss today. One All right. I think we can kick things off. This is a fair amount of people.

Adam Wozney: I'm sure some more folks will join. But thank you guys as always for joining the monthly SIG community call. Today is July 8th. We're halfway through the year. Can you believe it? Only six more community calls after this and then it's 2026. Pretty exciting. as always, I have a handful of things I want to cover, mostly focused on community programs and community activities. but before I get into my agenda, are there any agenda items you want to make sure we cover? Anything that you guys are thinking about, you want to discuss, I will add to the agenda right now. Anything at all? Nope. All right, then we'll get right into it.

Adam Wozney: So as a reminder, the SIG community call is for discussion, support, and management of Akos community initiatives. I'm focusing these calls now on the governance proposals that we've launched since really a couple years ago, but now we're really dialing in on the activities and programs that we are pushing out to the ecosystem. So first on the agenda are the community programs. those are mostly defined as programming that is specific to individuals inside of the insider community that focus on specific items beneficial and supportive of the ecosystem. So the first one in that list is the Vanguards again are technical support for Discord or Telegram or even Reddit if the case may be.

Adam Wozney: monthly the Vanguards fill out a feedback form highlighting things that happened month over month within the Vanguard's program in regards to technical support. I'm only going to call out a couple things from the past monthly feedback form average questions and user satisfaction. if you are interested in learning more about the Vanguards program and the more feedback on the Vanguards program, just let me know in the Sik community channel and I'll share some of that data. But at a high level, Vanguards, which we have 10 right now, they're answering one to five questions per day. That number can average, some days it might be only one question somebody answers. Some days it might be no one's really saying that they're responding to more than five questions per day, which I think is okay.

Adam Wozney: if we start to get to the point where we're getting above five questions from a majority of the Vanguards, then we will look to add more Vanguards to the community. But this number of 10 has been holding pretty steady for I don't know six to 12 months now. So it's a good thing in a way because we're responding to questions in a timely fashion. generally less than an hour or two, which is phenomenal. If you go to a lot of different Discords, I think you have to wait a couple days to get responses. but it's also highlights that we need more people to have tactical support, meaning we need more deployments. So if the number goes up, more questions being asked, more questions being answered, and we want to ask more people to join the Vanguard's program, which is a good problem to have because that means there's more people using AOS. but overall we're pretty steady at one to five questions per day for really the past few months, six to 12 months.


### 00:05:00

Adam Wozney: in terms of user satisfaction, Vanguards fill out whether or not the questions they're responding to and qu and the things that are coming in through Discord if users are left happy. And this month is the first time that% say that it's been satisfied. Usually it's around 75 to 90%. But this past month it was 100% satisfaction. So big shout out to everyone supporting the community there. keep it up.

Adam Wozney: Next on the agenda is the Ring Masters program. this is something we launched at the beginning of the year. it's probably one of our more successful community programs to date. last quarter, the Ring Masters held 37 events. Just let that soak in for a second. 37 local meetup events in their community, introducing people to talking about everything from how to interact with the AOS chat API to how to deploy in Akos to just networking events.

Adam Wozney: that number is a little bit I don't know the word I'm looking for. I don't know if that number is going to always be that high. And the reason for that is we did kind of a one-off event series around Akos Accelerate which Amanda might have some highle stuff for you guys to hear about on the community side from the Accelerate event that happened about two weeks ago now. they held ring masters held 12 watch parties.  So, if you get rid of those 12, that means we had 25 total events. But still, even without the influx of additional events through the oneoff accelerate watch parties that we held, 25 events is definitely nothing to, scratch your nose at. Is that the right term? I believe last quarter, Q1 of this year, we held 16 events. So, it's gone from 16 to 25.

Adam Wozney: And we did a rough calculation for Q3 kind of just forecasting how many ring masters are planning to host. and they're estimating 27 events right now. So it's still number go up. So the ring master events the local meetup events have been really successful. a majority of those events more than 50% are taking place in either India or Nigeria which isn't an issue but I do want to see numbers go up in other regions so we can really put pins all over the world.  So, it goes back to something I mentioned in previous calls. The sun never sets on an Akos event. high level, very good stuff. and one other note on the remasters. Last quarter, a of I think a little over 2,700 RSVPs from all the events, which is pretty fantastic. Those are 2,700 people that never heard of AOS before and now they do. So, we can start adding them to the funnel, trying to get them to deploy and help grow the network. So, big shout out to all the ring masters.

Adam Wozney: things are going super well next up is the navigators program. So, the navigators program is focused on working with larger potential clients that need access to many GPUs. So, not just one or two for running small workloads but 10 plus that will be using this on a monthly recurring basis.  So the ring masters program is designed to help educate potential projects on what a kosh is and how it can benefit them. coming up with systems design, so how they can plug in a kosh into their tech stack and then helping manage those deployments once they're live, making sure that those deployments are working Currently we have three navigators in the program. and we have a handful of clients that are going through the navigators pipeline.

Adam Wozney: Navigator's pipeline is basically what you'd see in a traditional business development pipeline. There's integrations folks and sales folks. those timelines from introduction to deployment can vary broadly and the navigator program is still pretty new. I don't know if I want to call it a pilot still because it's been around for almost six months, but it's still a fairly new program.  So, as things progress in the Navigators community and within the Navigators program, I'll be sure to update here in this s community call and, probably even in the steering committee calls what's happening monthly. So, things are going well in the navigator side of things. next up on the community program side is the alchemists.


### 00:10:00

Adam Wozney: So, Alchemist, just as a reminder, are a Kosh insiders who actively develop educational content for the edu platform. last quarter, I think we launched the first four courses in a beginner series of Akos edu, and we just launched this past week, Akos 105, which is focused on mass mastering the provider console. there's still four more that are under construction as a part of the beginner series of Akashi Once those four courses are completed, we'll have nine total courses available all for free, all go at your own pace for individuals to learn all the beginner stuff about Akos. once that's completed, hopefully by the end of this quarter, I'll start looking to intermediate and advanced courses.

Adam Wozney: And right now we have about 20 listed, but those are going to be under review. when I actually created those course the ideas behind those courses, it was maybe, I don't know, six to 12 months ago already. So, I some OCL folks. Want to review those with some insiders to make sure that the course curriculum makes sense still. Making sure that we're covering all the bases. So, once people get past these beginner nine courses, we get into the meat of Akos, like some deep technical stuff. good on the AOSDU side of things. real quick, high level, we haven't done any promotion for Akashi All we did was just change the old Omniflex platform, which is what we're using before for Akashi to our new platform on the website. So, when people go to AOSDU on the website, click, join a course, it goes to that platform. So, we haven't promoted it yet.

Adam Wozney: planning on promoting Akashiu properly probably in the next few weeks here as soon as we get those beginner courses complete because then we can say join AOSDU first nine curriculum live for anyone to use sign up and then we'll keep you in touch for future courses that go into the intermediate and advanced portions of AOS edu and we've had around 60 or so signups so good even without promotion around 25% of the folks have completed all the courses good to you and big shout out to all the alchemists helping construct that course curriculum. Last part of the programs before we go into questions is regional leads.

Adam Wozney: So for folks who are not familiar with the governance props that we put out on a quarterly basis, I put out a last week Scott Huisones help me put onchain the regional or sorry the community programs prop which right now is looking to pass that should wrap up in two days. Next we'll get into activities governance proposal which that should go this week sometime online for governance vote. only thing I want to call out there is I did update some of the budget and some of the items within those gov props. So, switching it up from six months ago when we put out the 2025 governance proposals for programs and activities. I did some updating based insider feedback and based off of community interest.

Adam Wozney: and one of those pieces of feedback and community interest is a new program that we're going to be launching called al so most of you might be familiar with this for folks that are Basically regional leads will be country specific community managers. So it will be a higher paying role. there will be not harder there will be more requirements for being regional leads.  they'll go through an application process and there will be monthly OKRs or goals that they will have to hit for being a regional lead. in addition to that the application process will actually have people pitching why they believe their country or their region is beneficial for AOS.

Adam Wozney: So basically the steps will be once the program's governance proposal is passes which it looks like it will be in the budget we have enough for four regional leads as kind of a pilot. So I'm using the next six months from July until December to see how the regional leads program is going. So if people join we get four people to be a part of the regional leads program. if it's successful, we'll look to get more budget to maybe expand the regional leads program and maybe even evaluate the entire kind of insider umbrella where all of these different programs kind of live restructuring things, changing things, and making sure that we're growing the network in a sustainable and in a way that is beneficial to everyone that's involved. So, the regional BISE program will be something we'll be launching here probably in the next month or so. first step will be application.

Adam Wozney: Second step is a selection process and the third step is just tracking kind of goals and making sure that people that are involved in the regional leads program are contributing to a cost in meaningful ways. I'll share very quickly because I do want to share what that whole process looks like. let me open this doc up quick. So for folks that are interested in the regional leads program, this is the beginning stage.


### 00:15:00

Adam Wozney: There will be an application process. as you guys can see here, I'm still kind of working on this, but application process is pretty straightforward. Who they are, what they're interested in, why they think their location is primed for kind of Akos ecosystem growth, a little bit about them, what gets them excited about being a regional lead, what they think the plan of attack will be within their community, and then maybe a few bonus questions.  So that'll be the first stage in this process. One other thing to note is regional leads is only open for people who are a caution siders. So the first step to getting more involved in the community joining the caution ciders program from there if it shows that people are engaged then you can kind of get involved with other activities inside of the community itself. So that's one thing to point out. The next step is going to be the selection process. So I'll share this real quick.

Adam Wozney: selection process is going to be pretty straightforward as well. once people apply, I'll review those things and then we'll pass it on to an eligibility screening. So basically you would interview for any kind of a job. because this is a higher paying role within the AOS Insiders program. we're going to onboard people in ways that we would a traditional role at any company or organization.  So eligibility screening will be me just getting to know why this person wants to do this, what their background is, getting a general sense of kind of what makes them want to be a regional lead. From there, I want to pull in our Vanguard community and specifically I want to pull in Vanguards because they're are more technical insiders.

Adam Wozney: So I want them to kind of dive into questions around technical understanding of Akos because if somebody's gonna be representing us on a country or a regional level, they need to be able to talk about Akos technically. They can't just say Akos is cool, but they have to talk about Akos in a technical manner. They don't have to be, a developer necessarily, but they have to, at least know that AOS's co codebase is built on for example. these are things that regional leads will have to  So that'll be the community review and then we'll do a final kind of deliberation with me and the Vanguards and then we'll make a decision yes or no if we move forward with that person. If we do we'll start our onboarding process. I saw a question in here. we had one in Portugal this week. I think that's separate. Put blacks asked is this going to be a full-time role?

Adam Wozney: I wouldn't call it a full-time role, but because this is a higher paying role because there's more requirements, it's really just depends on how much time someone can dedicate to this role. And that's something that we'll cover in the application process and the interview process.  So just quickly answering that. last thing I'll share on the regional lead side of things is once somebody's onboarded, they will have goals that we'll work with them we onboard somebody, we know they're going to be based in France. we'll work with them on developing their three-month strategy.

Adam Wozney: So, by the end of the three months, we'll agree with that person that they will have to have this thing done, they will have to have this thing done, they will have to have this thing, and so forth. And then at the end of that three-month process, if they don't really hit those goals, we'll have to decide on whether or not something we continue with this person or if they have good reasons why those goals weren't met, it's discussed and talked about because this is something because it is more money and this is more of a visible role. we need to make sure that things are being accomplished. so that'll be kind of the process and then once somebody's onboarded and at that three months if it's going we'll just kind of keep essentially renewing that role. So it'll be kind of going in a three-month spurt. So every 3 months people are reviewed. If it checks out we'll keep them going.

Adam Wozney: if we'll say, "Sorry, this doesn't seem like a good fit." And we'll try to find someone else either within that region or we'll just close that region down entirely and try to find someone in a region that they can sell the idea of why there should be an AOS ecosystem built there. So, that's the Any questions on any of those community programs I mentioned? Vanguards, ring masters, navigators, alchemists, regional leads? Andrew, go for it.

Andrew Gnatyuk: So, just to clarify, basically the regional lead should have to be a markettoologist that could sell a cash but still have to be technical enough to promote the cash and…


### 00:20:00

Andrew Gnatyuk: it's not a full-time job. It's and half of the budget from the regional leads should more or less go to the marketing,  because you still have to promote their cash.

Adam Wozney: Yes. …

Adam Wozney: it's a good question. On the budget side of the regional leads will be getting a reward monthly for being a regional lead that they can use for themselves just for being in this role. and they can also use some of that budget for some of their activities, events, sponsorships, things like that.

Adam Wozney: However, because we do have all these other programs, Vanguards, Ring Masters, Navigators, and the activities budget that I'm going to be putting out probably later this week, we can use some of those budget items for regional leads. that will all be case by case. We won't really know what that looks like until we start to work with someone.  So for example, if Andrew is interested, he wants to be a regional lead, puts in an application, goes through the process, he's onboarded, develops his OKRs, and one of those OKRs is like he wants to sponsor an upcoming event in two months that he found, sells that event as something that he thinks can help benefit his local ecosystem, help onboard new community members locally. We can use some of the budget items from our activities budget for those things.

Adam Wozney: so there is a little bit of wiggle room from regional lead budget to conferences, hackathon sponsorships, contributions, community events. So don't look at as the budget that regional leads get as that's all you get. There is opportunity if sold and developed as a part of the OKRs that we develop with those individuals that we can pull some budget from things for regional leads to utilize within their region. That's the best way to look at it.

Adam Wozney: Go for it, Andrew. Totally.

Andrew Gnatyuk: So, basically for the additional budget, should it be done basically just to talk to you or the community to get the additional budget or it should be done via the GitHub discussions and then explanation of why do you need the additional budget for as a regional campaign or something like that.

Adam Wozney: So I think it'll be a mixture of both. So if there's something that someone wanted to do within a certain region that doesn't fit in the community programs or community activities proposals that I put out there then it would go to a governance proposal to try to get funding for those activities because at the end of the day I don't have the budget for it. I couldn't help out with that.

Adam Wozney: But if there was an upcoming event for example that you showcased to me in the community like in the insiders channel or in one of the various channels on discord and you said this is something I really think would be beneficial to the local ecosystem and a kosh then we can pull some of those budget items that I put together in those two governance proposals for those activities.  So, I think it'll be kind of a case- by case basis, and we won't really know until we start to develop those OKRs and those monthly, quarterly goals with regional leads to figure out whether or not it makes sense to use some of the budget that's in these governance proposals or we go into a governance prop inside of GitHub that the community would vote on. So, I think it'll be somewhat case by Cool. All right.

Adam Wozney: Go for it, Andrew. How dare you?

Andrew Gnatyuk: Sorry, sorry,…

Andrew Gnatyuk: Last question. I'm sorry for bothering, but still I have a lot,

Adam Wozney: How dare you?

Andrew Gnatyuk: So, are there at least I don't know brief OKRs that should be met within the regional leads to know what we have to work for if we want to apply.

Adam Wozney: Yeah, absolutely. So, let me share this is my rough kind of dock for what the OKRs would be for kind of a legional lead. And I kind of look at this as a kind of a checklist of things that they can accomplish at given stages of a three-month period, at least kicking off kind of that role.

Adam Wozney: So this is still under development. So take a little bit with a grain of salt, but basically it's like month one is just forming a foundation of what exactly it is you're going to be doing locally and regionally within your given area. Month two is kind of activating those ideas and seeing what outcomes come of it. And then month three is actually spinning up additional things to kind of highlight what's working, what's not working, and expand on some of those ideas that we've developed in the previous two months.  Each of these kind of different monthly things will have different KPIs. So for example, one of the things I'm thinking about is city leads. So basically, if somebody's managing France, I want them to find somebody that they can onboard as an accashion cider to manage a wide person in Paris or a citywide person in Mars or in Kane or in Khan. So onboarding people in their region. So essentially they become what I do.


### 00:25:00

Adam Wozney: So I help manage a lot of the community initiatives here and we have the insiders program and that's a global thing. Ultimately I can't do this if we had a thousand people in this community with a thousand locations. I can't manage a thousand people. So the idea behind this is scaling up the community in a way that's sustainable. So I actually would start working with individuals on a countrywide level and then people underneath them they manage them specifically and kind of go that route.  So, I hate to say it, it's a traditional kind of hierarchal system. And maybe we'll switch this up someday where we have a DAO structure and all that, but at least to kickstart the way I'm structuring it is a fairly hierarchal system. but as it scales, I love to turn this into a DAO. I would love to kind of flatten out everything so that way I'm not the one that has to decide on all this stuff. I want it to be community effort. But to kickstart, I feel like it's important to have some sort of structure in this shape and fashion.

Adam Wozney: So to answer your question, I have some rough ideas on what these OKRs can be, but each kind of regional lead will help define those OKRs before they start their role. So by the end of a quarter, they can really say, " this is what I accomplished. This is what I didn't accomplish. Here's what it looks like." So I do have rough ideas around that. rew,  Any other questions on the community programs, regional leads, alchemists, navigators, ring masters, anything at all, Andrew? Come on.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Yeah, One last time, but It's just a suggestion. Wouldn't be beneficial for the regional reads when they are applying to the form to submit their three months proposal beforehand like they applying they have a vision of…

Andrew Gnatyuk: how to do it beforehand and then you will see if this works for cash or it doesn't.

Adam Wozney: So that is one of the application questions I don't want someone to take hours to define here's my three month year-long strategy…

Adam Wozney: but I do want some simple bullet points here are the five things that I want to do over the next three months and if it kind of aligns with how I'm thinking about things and if it seems

Adam Wozney: they have a baseline understanding of what they're talking about. And I'll be able to tell if somebody used Chat GBT for coming up with this. Believe me, I've done this long enough now where you're not going to fool me. don't s*** a s*****, as they say. I shouldn't be swearing on this. Virginers. I'll be able to tell. So, I want to see some baseline bullet points here's what the next, six to 12 months look like for me. Here's what I'm thinking I'll be doing. And then if it looks good, then we'll move them further along the application process.  Cool. I see a question from Yanick. Are the city leads funded through the regional leads budget? So, yeah, Yanick, I just put in city leads as kind of a rough idea. I don't even know if that's something that will be included in this. I think it's a valuable portion because if we can onboard more local leaders in different cities within a certain country, I think that's ultimately how we're going to scale the community and scale the ecosystem.

Adam Wozney: So I do think that's something that I'll want to include in OKRs, but that's something we'll have to ce with the regional leads on board. I think all regional leads are going to have some highle generalized OKRs and goals that are in place, but France is going to be very different in culture, in ecosystem and technologies, in other communities of interest than you maybe see I don't know in Japan. So, we'll have to codify those goals with the regional leads, but I think there will be some generalized kind of goals that go across the board that everyone will have to accomplish.

Adam Wozney: Otherwise, it's hard to track and hard to measure what's successful and what's not if you don't have kind of baselines across different regions, So, that's how I'm generally thinking about it right now. Any other questions on the programs before I move on to activities and events? All right, cool. So,…

Adam Wozney: Andrew, unbelievable.

Andrew Gnatyuk: I was just kidding.

Andrew Gnatyuk: I was kidding. That's was a joke.

Adam Wozney: He's just messing. How do I kick people out of this? I got to kick people out of here. all right. Let me quickly pull something up and I'll cover this. So, in GitHub, give me one second. I had it open and I clicked out of the tab. go.

Adam Wozney: So, in GitHub, you'll probably noticed a couple weeks ago, I put in a dove prop on community programs and activities updated guidelines and kind of goals and budget. so, in here, let me share my screen real quick. Share discussions. So, here is  updated. Yep. So, I put this in two weeks ago. We just covered the programs proposal which live. It's looking like it's going to pass. So, I'm going to squeeze I'm going to bypass the program side, but the activity side I did make some changes. So, initially at the beginning of the year, I had a hackathons budget and that was really focused on sponsored hackathons and owned hackathons.


### 00:30:00

Adam Wozney: the idea of us owning our own hackathon right now is very difficult. It's time intensive. Takes away a lot of time from all these other things that we're doing. and sponsoring hackathons is difficult too because we didn't really create a framework for how people can kind of get access to those budgets. So I tweaked the budget for that and made it focus specifically on insiders who showcase hackathons or conferences in their region.  they think Kosh this is specifically for sponsorship. So if Andrew sees a conference happening in Ukraine that will have AI developers and fans he will essentially come to the community in this call and say hey there's an event coming up. I would love to get some sponsorship budget for this. We'll review it as a community.

Adam Wozney: If there's no red flags, we'll take some of the budget that we have in this and give it to Andrew for sponsoring that event. Beyond the sponsorship money, it's really up to Andrew to define what we're looking to get out of that event. So, it could be honestly if people are fine with it, we just attach our name to it like Akos sponsored event XYZ place.  But I think ultimately if we're going to be showcasing this in a community sig call, there should be some additional value ad like sponsoring the event and I'm also going to be giving a workshop on a kosh there. That makes sense. same thing goes with Hackathons are hard. rewards, planning judging, planning tracks, planning mentorship. There's a lot that goes into hackathon planning.

Adam Wozney: But if Andrew actually comes up, I'm just using you as an example because you kept raising your hand, if Andrew says, "There's a hackathon going on in Ukraine. It's focused on AI. People need access to cheap GPUs. I think we should sponsor this. I'm going to help create the tracks. I'm going to help mentor. I'm going to judge pitched in a SID call. there's no, red flags. Everyone approves it. We'll pull some of the budget from the hackathons conferences budget to give to Andrew to participate in that event." this is specific to sponsorship. So if it's far away if for example someone in France is based in con but there's a hackathon happening in Paris the budget isn't for people traveling to that. It's specifically for sponsorship. So that would you have to take that into account. It have to be like a virtual activation that way.

Adam Wozney: But at least this way it's a way for Akos to kind of get its name out there for different events in a quicker fashion because I'll have quick access to this budget and all we need to do is just highlight these things in the sick community channel or on these calls. So the quick and dirty of the hackathon conferences is if you have an idea you think that there's something worthwhile attending or participating in a hackathon or conference locally put it in the SIG community chat. here's an upcoming event.  I would love to discuss this in a community call and move forward on it. So that's really quickly the quick and dirty on the hackathons's Community events, this is new as well. So initially the community events budget was for conferences that Akos was sponsoring through Amanda's governance proposals. So for example, I always use H Denver as an example. So We know we're going to send some insiders, some community members. We're going to have a side event. We're going to have a booth. We're going to have a presence there.

Adam Wozney: The idea is I would actually look to local community organizers and say, "Hey, we're going to have some Macage people on site. We would love to sponsor your local event group and give them some pizza. Get someone from Akos to give a presentation and then after we leave those cities after the events are over, we will have a connection with someone locally." I did that for Denver. The process was long, time inensive. finding people was difficult. It was just a difficult thing to plan.  So, I'm moving that budget around and instead of focusing it on sponsoring local meetup events, I want to take insiders to events that aren't a part of Amanda's larger kind of full-on event proposal where we have a large presence and attend events of significance that can be beneficial to Akos and beneficial to the insider community to get them more involved inside of the Akash ecosystem.


### 00:35:00

Adam Wozney: So basically looking at what are some upcoming events for example right now I don't believe DevCon is on the list DevCon from my understanding is a very well attended event very developer focused across different ecosystems across different blockchains so instead of actually taking a sponsorship budget that Amanda's been working on and saying we're going to have a booth there we're going to have a side event we're sponsoring these events basically bringing two to three people go to that event as a kosh representatives find connecting  with local community organizers, getting a vibe of what's going on within the space, and then once that thing is over, reporting out, saying, "Here's what we accomplished as just attendees at these events. Here's how we can plug more people into what we're doing locally." there's a lot of benefits from this, but the one that I'm really thinking is a benefit is bringing some insiders that haven't been able to participate in some of these other events, getting them more connected and getting them more involved in the community.

Adam Wozney: and kind of tying and making those bonds between insiders a little bit stickier. So that's kind of that aspect of the community events budget. So it shifted from sponsoring local events sending insiders to events representing a Kosh and full-on swag and all that kind of stuff and keeping a finger on a pulse of what's going on within the space at larger kind of community or more grassroots conferences or events.  That budget's fairly malleable, so we can probably change it for a few things, but the high level, that's what it looks like. So, that'll be a part of the activities budget that goes up this week. Lastly, before any questions you guys have is community bounties. This is something one of our insiders has been really spearheading. if you're curious about this, just go into the GitHub and leave your thoughts before the activities proposal live. But high and low high and low of it is we really spun it up in Q1.

Adam Wozney: Q2 we got our ducks in a row and now Q3 I think we're really starting to move with on all cylinders finding new people to contribute to Akos supporting them along the way negotiating with them for resources and tracking things and what they have actually produced. So that's the high level the communities the community bounties really it should be called now community contributions. that's it. Any questions on the activities portion of the community going once?

Adam Wozney: Andrew of course has one.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Yeah. Yeah.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Of course. So, no, that's just a tricky question that I want to know the gross proposal that has passed right for 4.2 million has also hackathons as a part of their partnerships.

Adam Wozney: Yeah. Hello.

Andrew Gnatyuk: So there is two questions I want to ask basically who is going to be responsible to the portion of the budget related to hackathons and if we as a community can tweak some of the budget from there to sponsor some local original or…

Andrew Gnatyuk: I don't know semi Europe hackathons as well I don't

Adam Wozney: So I cannot speak to that proposal…

Adam Wozney: because I was not involved in it at all.

Adam Wozney: So in terms of what hackathons are a part of that in terms of what is being decided that is something that I'm sure will come up in normal conversation internal OCL and maybe some of these SIG steering calls or these other SIG calls but in terms of what they plan on using that hackathon budget for I do not know. I'm assuming it'll be hackathons that come across our desk and then they can quickly spin up some cash to send them for sponsorship for getting involved to find hackers that can contribute to Akos. I don't think that's a bad thing that I don't know these things. It's just I wasn't involved in the creation of that proposal. that's completely separate. That's part of a growth kind of strategy that is being developed internally at OCL that benefits Ultimately, all of this is going to be benefiting Kosh at the end of the day.

Adam Wozney: So just because I wasn't involved in that hackathon portion doesn't mean that's a bad thing. So I can't really speak to that. If you have questions on that, head over to that If you have questions on that, head over to that proposal. Leave your thoughts in there. I know it's already passed, so there's not much that can be done other than, just making comments. So if you do have questions on that portion of the proposal, put it in there and then hopefully somebody will get to it or we can get somebody to look at it.  In terms of this hackathons, this is very specific to insiders. So if insiders are seeing that there's a conference coming up or a hackathon coming up that they think we should be involved in, They'll bring it to the SIG community call. We'll pitch it and then I'll have quick access to funds to sponsor those events, to get involved in those events. again, this is specifically for sponsorship. It's not for bringing people out there. So if somebody's pitching a local event in their city, no problem.


### 00:40:00

Adam Wozney: they can go to it. But if its maybe a little bit farther away, your regional event, the budget won't include travel costs. So that's something just to be very clear. But this is specifically for insiders that find events that they think are valuable. pitch it to the other insiders, pitch it in the same community calls, and then if there's no red flags, I have quick access to budget that I can send to folks to get involved. and then reporting out all that will be coming as things progress. But that's my quick and dirty on the hackathon stuff. any other questions on the activities portion of the proposal that should go up this week? So, Amanda was on. It looks like she had a jump.

Adam Wozney: all I can say on the event side is AOS Accelerate went off without a big shout out to everybody that helped out at the event on site and held watch parties. We had more people attend the watch parties than Accelerate itself, which isn't a fair comparison because, this is around the world, multiple events, but still pretty cool. I believe all the content live now on YouTube. go and share that with folks if you're interested.  The next big events that Amanda is focused on, which she talks about at her events working group calls, which I think she maybe had one recently, is ICML, which is a machine learning event that's happening next week in Toronto or Vancouver. and then Nurups, which is I believe an AI kind of cryptographic research event that happens also, I think that one happens in San Diego, which is great. I can attend that one. I live in San Diego.

Adam Wozney: So that's the next one she's planning, but that's not until November. She's also starting to think about a lot of local meetups, specifically in San Francisco and New York that we can get involved in. There's a lot of AI stuff happening there. But if you do have any events related questions, just go over to the events working group because Amanda will be able to answer that stuff. and that's it with 17 minutes to spare. Any other questions on anything I discussed today? anything you guys wanted to bring out or call up finally.

Andrew Gnatyuk: I'm gonna just keep silent until somebody's ask the questions but if they not then we can resume the dialogue.

Adam Wozney: No, worries. Any other questions from anyone? We have looks like 17 minutes left before we wrap up.

Adam Wozney: Otherwise, we're gonna end early. Any other questions? Andrew, go for it.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Now I'll pass to Rodri for that right now than then me because I'm just basically asking questions. Sorry.

Adam Wozney: No, no worries. Go for it, Rodri. So,…

Rodri R: I was just going to ask any plans about Cosmo Burst.

Adam Wozney: you'd have to talk to Amanda. I'm not sure where that stands right now. I'm pretty sure she's in conversations with the Cosmo team, but I don't know where it stands in terms of any sponsorship or how Akos will be involved in it. so yeah, you can ping Amanda in the working groups channel and Andrew, go for it.

Andrew Gnatyuk: So, basically the same question I asked during the steering committee and basically during the sig economics that for the events for us it would be great to hear to have some recap that could be a part of the content and part of what we achieved for the money that has been spent from the community pool for the events. yeah, and I'm just like raising it up again on the difference six cuz everybody's saying,…

Andrew Gnatyuk: "Yeah, that's a good portion that we should take care of." But, we're just talking and we still have no recaps and it would be great to have some.  Yeah. Yeah.

Adam Wozney: Yep, I completely hear you.

Adam Wozney: I made a note of that again because I know it's something you've brought up a few times. Best thing I can tell you is in the events working group and Discord is tag Amanda and say this is a recurring theme. At a minimum, I would just suggest a quarterly events kind of sponsored events recap. list out the things that you'd like to know how many people were in attendance, did any of those attendees turn into, people that entered the Navigators program, where do things stand in terms of what happened at those events?


### 00:45:00

Adam Wozney: So, whatever you're interested in learning about that, I would push that to Amanda in the working group because she manages that budget. She manages the events themselves. So, that's definitely something I think she should be able to handle for you. So, if she doesn't just keep pinging her and then eventually if it becomes an issue, I'm sure it'll go up the chain and then somebody will say, "Okay, we got to get this figured out." But right now, keep pushing nda. Tag her in the events working group. She can help you out with Any other questions,…

Andrew Gnatyuk: I got it.

Adam Wozney: comments, anything at all in this month's SIG community call? All right, I think that'll do it then. So, thank you guys for joining today's SIG community As a reminder, the governance proposal for programs is still live.

Adam Wozney: If you haven't voted yet, vote yes so we can actually fund all these things that we've been discussing here. The community activities proposal should go live this week. Go vote yes for that as well or vote no. Make me sad, but that's okay. I understand. Everyone has their opinion. but go and vote for those things because everything that I talked about today is all funded through those proposals. So, as always, thank you guys for joining and if you have any questions, comments, concern, head over to the Sik community channel and Discord. And I'll leave you with this.

Adam Wozney: As I always do, we'll see you in the metaverse. Later, everybody.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Do we have to see…

Andrew Gnatyuk: how many days the Bing men life like lives?

Adam Wozney: That's only for insiders. And if you're not an insider,…

Andrew Gnatyuk: Okay. Yeah.

Adam Wozney: you're not hearing that. So, don't give away the secret sauce,…

Andrew Gnatyuk: Got it.

Adam Wozney: Andrew. That's exclusive.

Andrew Gnatyuk: 

Andrew Gnatyuk: Yeah. You have to be an insider. So yeah.

Adam Wozney: Don't even Nobody heard what he was talking about. All right. Nobody knows what he was saying there.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Yeah. Bye.

Adam Wozney: Apply to the insiders if you're interested. We need you guys. Anyways, all right, guys.

Adam Wozney: I'll see you in the metaverse later, guys.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Bye guys. Bye.
