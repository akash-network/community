## Meeting Notes

### Opening Remarks & General Updates
- Adam began the meeting with informal conversation, welcoming everyone and confirming attendance.  
- Weather-related small talk broke the ice before transitioning into community updates.  
- Adam officially opened the November 2025 SIG Community Monthly Sync and confirmed it was the second-to-last call for the year.  

### Community Budget & Program Restructuring
- Due to budget reductions, no Q4 community governance proposal was submitted.  
- Current programs (Vanguards, Ring Masters, Navigators) remain active but operate at a smaller scale.  
- Overclock Labs now covers community expenses directly, prompting closer review and stricter allocation of funds.  
- Adam emphasized that reduced funding presents an opportunity to refine initiatives, focus on quality, and maintain manageable workloads.  

### Insiders Program (Ambassadors)
- The Insiders Program serves as Akash’s entry-level ambassador initiative.  
- Membership decreased from ~60 to 44 active insiders due to low engagement.  
- Adam now requires participants to submit a quarterly feedback form.  
- Members who failed to respond or contribute were removed, opening space for new applicants (averaging 1–2 applications per day).  
- The result has been a noticeable increase in engagement and activity among remaining members.  

### Vanguards Program
- The Vanguards, responsible for technical support on Discord, were reduced from 10 to 3 paid members.  
- Despite the reduction, most continue contributing voluntarily, demonstrating strong community commitment.  
- Adam hopes to restore funding and onboard more paid Vanguards in 2026.  

### Ring Masters Program
- Ring Masters organize local events, meetups, and hackathons.  
- Funding requests now require detailed proposals with clear goals and expected outcomes.  
- Only insiders can apply for event sponsorships.  
- Adam is currently reviewing 5–6 pending applications and asked members to follow up via Discord for updates.  

### Navigators Program
- Navigators function as business development and integrations leads.  
- With the recent hiring of a Head of Sales at Overclock Labs, the Navigators program is temporarily reduced.  
- The goal is to expand once inbound requests for GPU access and integrations increase.  

### Alchemists Program
- The Alchemists are community content creators contributing to Akash EDU.  
- Seven community-created courses are already live, with excellent feedback.  
- There remains a small budget for additional curriculum development.  
- Interested contributors must be part of the Insiders Program to qualify for funding or collaboration.  

### New Initiatives
- **Regional Leads Program:** Initially designed with its own budget, now transitioned into a volunteer-driven initiative.  
  - Regional Leads will represent Akash locally, support community onboarding, and coordinate activities.  
  - Recruitment has begun, with 1–2 volunteers expected to onboard in the coming weeks.  
- **Red Team Program:** A newly launched social media engagement initiative aimed at expanding Akash’s presence across Twitter and other platforms.  
  - Members act as “digital advocates,” engaging influencers and discussions to highlight Akash.  
  - Currently has 9 members, open to both insiders and general community participants.  
  - Adam compared its spirit to the LINK Marines and XRP Army, focused on organic advocacy and brand amplification.  

### Governance and Proposals Discussion
- Germany Beal raised concerns about how Overclock’s internal budget cuts might affect governance proposals.  
- Adam clarified that Overclock’s reductions apply only to its internal programs.  
- Community governance proposals remain independent and can still be proposed and voted on-chain.  
- Future proposals will face closer scrutiny to ensure alignment with Overclock’s direction and Akash’s roadmap.  
- Germany suggested improving alignment and communication about Overclock’s high-level priorities to guide contributors.  
- Adam recommended reviewing the Akash product roadmap on the official site to understand Overclock’s development priorities and open collaboration opportunities.  

### Community Engagement & Future Direction
- Adam encouraged members to join the Insiders Program to gain structured involvement and direct communication.  
- Emphasis on creating programs that are mutually beneficial—helping participants grow personally and professionally while advancing Akash.  
- The goal is to maintain an active, skilled core of contributors rather than broad but shallow participation.  

### Events and Representation
- Adam announced his attendance at DevConnect (Amsterdam) at his own expense, representing Akash at various sessions.  
- The final event of the year will be NeurIPS (Machine Learning Conference), featuring:  
  - A dedicated Akash workspace  
  - Coffee trucks for networking  
  - Developer engagement sessions  
- More updates will follow after NeurIPS concludes in early December.  

### Community Project Update — Germany Beal
- Germany provided an update on his community service project:  
  - The second proposal narrowly missed approval due to validator vote changes.  
  - His team continues to build and deploy multiple applications using Akash infrastructure.  
  - Current projects are generating modest but growing usage volumes, especially on GPU and inference workloads.  
  - The team is focused on completing milestone 2 and may resubmit a revised proposal later.  
  - Germany welcomed community members to reach out on Discord for collaboration or testing access.  

### Closing Remarks
- Adam thanked everyone for their continued contributions and community engagement.  
- He encouraged participants to share thoughts and feedback in the #sig-community channel.  
- The next and final 2025 SIG Community Meeting will be held in December.  
- Meeting adjourned with appreciation and a lighthearted “See you in the metaverse.”

## **Transcript**

Rodri R: Hello guys.

Adam Wozney: GM everybody.

Germany Beal: We're dumping up.

Adam Wozney: I'm just making an announcement in the SIG channel. Let folks know we're kicking Send that off. Let's make sure we got everything here. That Cool.

Adam Wozney: Got my notes. Excellent. Give it another minute. See if anyone else can join. How's everyone doing on this lovely Wednesday? I believe it's Wednesday.

Germany Beal: doing all right.

Germany Beal: We had a cold front, so it was cold as f***, but we'll get through it.

Adam Wozney: Yeah. Where…

Adam Wozney: where are you based?

Germany Beal: I'm in Florida.

Adam Wozney: Florida. Got it. so yeah,…

Germany Beal: So, yeah, anything under 70 degrees is cold as s***.

Adam Wozney: you're probably Yeah.

Germany Beal: So, I'm like, what the f***?

Adam Wozney: Yeah, I get that. I'm in San Diego and when it only gets cold in the winter. but during the day it'll rarely get below 55° and then in the evenings it can get down to maybe 40, but it never gets cold enough where it'll freeze or anything. Santiago. Yeah.

Germany Beal: Wait, is San Dieago god, I always anchor man all the time. So is in that tempered climate is that San Francisco where it's the same year round no matter what?

Adam Wozney: I would say so I looked it up our average temperature year round is 64.2 degrees. So, pretty comfortable and not dry, just nice and comfortable. 64.2 degrees. so yeah, today I'm looking outside, it's sunny and probably 65 right now. So, pretty pleasant. I appreciate San Diego. Yeah. Yeah.

Germany Beal: Man, that's crazy. I mean, that's how I felt like, I'm always in Portland, Oregon because that's my second home. It just most summertime is perfect, It's 65 as a low, high is 75. I'm like, dude, this is lit.

Adam Wozney: Yeah. it's pretty cozy. yeah, it is definitely more taxes,…

Adam Wozney: but it's called the sunshine tax. And for me it's worth it. I'd rather pay a little bit more money to have perfect weather all the time.

Germany Beal: Fair enough.

Adam Wozney: All right, we're five minutes in. I think I can kick things off. Thank you guys for joining today's SIG community monthly sync on the 12th of November, 2025. We have one more until it's a new year. How about that, guys? as always, I have a number of agenda items I want to make sure I cover, but is there anything that you guys want to make sure we bring up in this call?

Germany Beal: I actually would like to give a status update on the current project that we're working on at some point. That would be kind of dope.

Adam Wozney: Okay, Germany. Got you on the agenda.  any other items anybody wants to call out or make sure that we cover in this call too. All right, then I'll kind of get right into it. yeah so as you guys all know we reduced the budget for community programs because of numerous reasons which I covered in last month's call but that means I did not put together a Q4 community governance proposal. So all the community programs that we're paying for which have been reduced in scope are now being covered at least for this quarter.

Adam Wozney: Hopefully that will change in 2026. We'll kind of cross that bridge when we get there. by Overclock Labs. So does that whereas before a lot of the community programs, Vanguards, Ring Masters, Navigators, I was a little bit more comfortable just kind of reviewing things quickly and pushing things out. Now because it's being covered by Overclock Labs, I am kind of reviewing these things a little bit more with a fine-tuned comb.  Best example I can give you is on ring masters as you guys know are event organizers. They're individuals who host event around the world introducing people from my vantage point it's been very successful. I think I mentioned this in last call. This year alone there was 95 91 events held by community members themselves introducing people to Akos whether it was big or small. reaching almost 9,000 people who attended those events which is pretty great.


### 00:05:00

Adam Wozney: because we've reduced it now when people want to host events and represent a kosh whether it's sponsoring a conference whether it's hosting a meetup event whether it's putting together or hosting a hackathon I've created a new form for anyone that's in the community to request those funds and for me to review there isn't as much funds to go around so that's why I have to review it so closely I have to make sure that what we're trying to accomplish can be accomplished  So, I am a little bit more dicial or dictator-esque in passing out and doing out those funds just because as as we did throughout the past year. I actually don't look at this as a bad thing. I think it's always good to kind of take a step back and say, "Okay, what have we accomplished? What's working? How can we improve upon things?" And that's kind of how I'm reviewing the programs right now and the budget that we put together. So, it's not necessarily a bad thing.

Adam Wozney: I think it just gives us an opportunity to kind of review what's worked, what's not working, and kind of improve some of those things on a smaller scale. for me, because I'm a solo community person, on a more manageable scale, even though I wasn't hosting myself the 91 events, working with all the different community members that held those events, it takes a lot of time and it just takes up a lot of brain power. So, to be able to shrink things down a bit is actually not necessarily a bad thing for me. so yeah, just wanted to call that out. so that's the budget stuff. In terms of the programs, we still have the programs. They're still up and going even though some have been reduced in size and we've changed kind of some of the outlooks on some of those things. So, as I've mentioned in the past, the big things that I really focus on, from overclock's perspective within the community are the ambassador programs. So, everyone knows here, you've heard me mention it before, the insiders is the ambassador program of the community. It's kind of the first step for people saying, I want to get more involved.

Adam Wozney: I've actually reduced the amount of insiders. we were at around 60 something about a month ago and I've actually removed a number of insiders where we're now around 44. And the reason for that is, while there are really no requirements, that's not true. There's really no requirements except for one, which is right now I'm requesting once a quarter, so every three months, so it's not that much.  insiders fill out a general feedback form about the community, what's working, what's not working, what are some things we could do to improve, what are some things you enjoy about the community, all that stuff. And I take all of that and I use it to better I use it to improve our community efforts. I left it open for this feedback form. I left it open for a month and I posted it regularly inside of a private channel just for our insider community. And for folks that didn't respond to it, I reached out individually and said, "Why didn't you respond?"

Adam Wozney: if they didn't get back to me or their excuses did not make sense, I said, "Just doesn't seem like you have the time for the program, I'm going to remove you and then maybe someday we can approach that and bring you back in." And I'm doing that because I have currently around 60 or so applications. We average about one or two applications per day to join. So, there's a lot of people that want to participate and get involved.  and I only want to keep people in this that are regularly engaged, that are active, that are trying to tribute, that want to grow as a part of the program. So, I did remove a number of insiders for that. So, I just wanted to call it that highlevel thing. and for what it's worth, I feel like I've seen more involvement inside the community at least inside the insiders program since removing those individuals and only seeing the folks that are actively engaged because I assume if somebody's raising their hand saying, "Hey, I want to join the insiders program."

Adam Wozney: It's because They They want to connect with other individuals that are doing similar things to them. So, I think this is not a bad thing. it just opens up more positions for folks inside the community to join this kind of top tier tip of the Akos community spear. So, that's the high level on the kind of overall insiders program.  in terms of Vanguards. So, because of the reduced budget, we've actually shrunk the Vanguard's community from 10 to three. the good news is I think it just shows the power of the community members that are involved. a majority of those individuals said, "Hey, I still want to volunteer to be part of the Vanguard program." Which is pretty cool. so while we've reduced the amount of paid Vanguards, we still have the same amount of Vanguards.


### 00:10:00

Adam Wozney: and Vanguards for everyone's familiarity in case you don't know or people watching the recording, their technical support on Discord. it'd just be impossible without community members that are, interested and willing and able to respond to technical questions about Kosh for us to respond to those questions. so I'm pretty happy even though I had to reduce the amount of paid Vanguards. but I do think, again, we don't know what the future holds.  I'm hoping that in the new year we can kind of go back to onboarding some individuals that are active and engaged within the program. but going back to what I said originally too, I do think that this is just a good opportunity. hold on one second. My babysitter's here.  This.

Adam Wozney: Give me one second, guys. Talk amongst yourself. There's somebody here I got to deal with.

Germany Beal: So, how's everyone doing?

Jaseemuddin Naseem: I'm doing fine. Germany, what about you?

Germany Beal: H doing good, Just been working to work in getting some deliverables out. How about yourself?

Jaseemuddin Naseem: Just attending meetings and nothing else. Yeah.

Germany Beal: Nice. yeah.

Germany Beal: Since we have some people in the community here, is there anything that excites you that either you've been building or that anyone else here been seeing that is currently being built on top of Akash?

Jaseemuddin Naseem: Yep. I think was the thing that was exciting,…

Jaseemuddin Naseem: but it's on hold right now.

Adam Wozney: All right.

Adam Wozney: Sorry about that,…

Jaseemuddin Naseem: It's back.

Adam Wozney: It was a door-to-d dooror salesman trying to sell us free estimates for a home remodel, and I'm like, we're good. Get out of here. Guess he was ringing the doorbell a bunch and our baby's sleeping. I'm like, bro. Anyways, all right, that's enough about me. That's the pleasure of owning a home. So, that's the quick update on the Vanguard's program. Again, I'm hoping that we can onboard some more paid folks, in the future, but for now, it's actually turning out kind of So, that's Vanguards. On the so ring masters again are local event organizers. I do have a small budget that I can use for individuals that would like to either sponsor or host their own events or hackathons or conferences. and I've opened that up to the insider community specifically.

Adam Wozney: So, for folks who are not insiders, I know Germany even though you're pretty engaged, we should definitely talk about you potentially joining. this is open for insiders to gain budget for events they'd like to host or get involved in. I am reviewing again with a fine tooth comb. I'm behind on the five or six applications that have come in for me to review. I'm hoping that maybe on the plane I can review those things, but I have responded to a couple folks with some pretty detailed questions.  Ultimately, we're only going to be able to support individuals that have a very clear strategy, very clear outcomes that we know will be beneficial to the ecosystem. so if anyone is interested and would access to those funds, join the insiders program, fill out the application form and I will review and get back to individuals. but again, for folks that have filled it out on this call, I am a little behind. I apologize. Just keep bugging me on Discord.


### 00:15:00

Adam Wozney: I promise I will get an answer to you one way or the other. navigator's program. So, we actually hired a head of sales, you guys might have seen at overclock who's managing a lot of the incoming requests for people that need access to high performance GPUs. and he is working with a couple different community members. so the navigators program has kind of been shrunken down to until the head of sales really kind of gets a better understanding of incoming and traffic and all that.  So, I'm hoping that we can onboard more navigators and navigators again are like business development reps. They sit down with potential users, work through their problems, their issues, hand it off to integrations navigators who actually systems architect solutions for their problems. we do have some navigators that are still kind of involved, but we have shrunk that down a little bit as well, which is okay.

Adam Wozney: I'm hoping that we get more incoming, more leads, more things coming in that we can start to bring in more community members to get involved in kind of this top tier program within the insiders community. So, that's a quick update on navigators. alchemists are content creators for Akash edu. budget was shrunk down for that as well, but luckily we already have seven courses on there. the feedback has been really pretty outstanding for those courses that have been community developed and created through Akos edu. but I do have a budget for small curriculum projects that we can build out. So I'm working with a couple different folks on that. But if you are a content creator, you understand pretty well because you're going to be talking about AOS in demo videos, quizzes, and prerequisite docs. you have to be an insider to gain access to that. so let me know if you're interested.

Adam Wozney: send me a DM or apply to join the insiders program. I did want to call out because this is I won't call this out. I'm not going to call that out. I'm going to message someone individually on that. that's a surprise. I know everyone's curious what I was going to say. Don't worry about it. You'll find out someday. two other things which are kind of newer and one's been around, but I've updated what the program is and one is brand new. We've launched two new initiatives. one is the regional lead program, which at first, I had a big budget for it. I had a whole bunch of things that we had planned out, but that budget went away completely. so instead, I'm opening up regional leads. and these are individuals that essentially do what I do on a global level, onboarding community members, supporting individuals that are introducing people to on a local level, I'm opening that up as a volunteer program.

Adam Wozney: I'm hoping that the folks that have raised their hands that are interested in actually kind of doing what I do on a regional level, we can showcase some big wins and then I can highlight that to get some sources of support, resources, funding to continue to do those initiatives. But until we fully launch this and onboard kind of regional leads, which I'm behind on because there's a bunch of other stuff that I'm working on right now. we just won't know.  So, I'm hoping that within the next few weeks, we'll have one or two regional leads as volunteers and we'll see how it goes. that's really something that I'm very passionate about and I want to spend time on, but I need to get through a cornucopia of other things before I can really focus on the onboarding regional leads and supporting those individuals. the big thing that I am focused on right now is a new program that I'm calling red team. And some of you are members of red team already, some of you are not.

Adam Wozney: Red team is basically a social media initiative to kind of expand our scope and our reach and our scale across Twitter and across other social media channels. Think of them as the link marines and maybe a good element of the XRP army if you're familiar with them even though those guys are kind of gross. think of them as individuals that engage with other Twitter influencers, Twitter or projects of note and introduce them to Akos in meaningful ways. So if Sam Alman posts we're doing XYZ thing someone could actually go in and respond an AOS representative as a part of this red team and say hey have you looked at AOS there's actually some cool things that you might be interested in and engaging with individuals that way.

Adam Wozney: Basically, at a high level, it's about scaling out our influence across social media. we have nine members of the team right now. I am actively looking for people that are not insiders. This is open to the general community to join that. So, if anyone is interested, want to learn more, you can send me a DM on Discord orers, go into the SIG community channel on Discord and say, "Hey, I'd be interested to learn more about Red Team." it's only been around for a week and so far it's been going really well. I'm really excited about it.  I think there's a lot of potential with the red team. That's it for the high level community programs. Any questions on anything I covered here so far? Cool.


### 00:20:00

Germany Beal: Yeah, I got some questions on that. So, a few things that you said I just want to clarify. So, it sounds like since you guys are doing some budget cuts on a lot of the programs, how would this affect projects that are currently building as well as doing proposals for Akos? do you think that might have any effect on that or this is only from overclock?

Adam Wozney: This is specifically from overclock.

Adam Wozney: So if you or anyone has an idea, a gov prop, whatever, anyone can still go up and put those g props on chain for a vote. it really just depends on if the community votes yes or no. …

Germany Beal: Yeah, I mean I understand…

Adam Wozney: we're at the end of the day.

Germany Beal: but since overclock controls the funds I was just curious about almost choked on my water but I was just curious

Germany Beal: just to learn more about since overclock is doing cut that seems like proper would it be possible either now or down the road something like if it would change the mission in which the proposal you want passed I know I mean we can talk about high level anyone can do it governance blah blah blah blah blah which is fine but does overclock specifically have a direction or  have a particular mission in terms of all right here's some of the projects ideally if you do a proposal we will like this I know you guys can't control that but it will be really beneficial for either new current or even future contributors to understand just so there's a general alignment

Adam Wozney: Yeah, great question.

Germany Beal: There'll be another

Adam Wozney: While so I can't speak on maybe behalf of all of overclock, but I think I can speak at a high level of maybe what the general vibe is. I think any governance proposal or any initiative that would be requesting funds from the community pool will be scrutinized a bit more and will be gone through with a fine tooth comb a bit more similar to…

Adam Wozney: how I mentioned event organizers now because overclock is paying for it and not from the community pool. I'm reviewing these a little bit more granular than I maybe would have in the past…

Germany Beal: a little bit.

Adam Wozney: because we are trying to manage budget, manage the community pool in as a steward's way as possible. ultimately overclock doesn't control the community pool, but I think…

Germany Beal: But What will I guess?

Adam Wozney: what you're saying is it's good to review how overclock is perceiving things at a high level and kind of align with that a bit. I don't know if that answers your question, but that's kind of how I perceive it and think about it. kind of going along with how we're doing things internally, I don't think is necessarily a bad way to kind of think through proposals that you want to put together for things that are beneficial to Akos.

Germany Beal: Mhm.

Adam Wozney: Ultimately if a community member comes in and says, "Hey, I have a team of professionals that are going to build XYZ thing. They're going to help produce, XYZ new community members.  they're going to help onboard, new startups and other thing. I think those will all be beneficial things that people will review and say, "Okay, we should definitely push our way behind it and say we want to get involved." But ultimately, it's up to individuals to kind of push those things forward. so that's how I'm thinking about it, me personally at a high level, but take that as you will.

Germany Beal: Yeah, I hear and also as the community new and current community members, get on boarded, go through the process and build. what's looking for? Is there particular requirements that you guys would like to see out of overclock?

Germany Beal: Whether it is just growing the community or just bringing in more applications on top of it or is it just everything in the kitchen sink?

Adam Wozney: Honestly I think a bet the best place to go for that on the product level would be the road map…

Adam Wozney: which you can go and access just on the website look at the community roadmap or the product road map that'll kind of really showcase what are the priority objectives from  the overclock lab side of things, like things that are going to be beneficial to the product long term. So, that's a good place to go for product and even get involved because there's links to GitHub, there's links to repos, there's links to all sorts of stuff there. So, that's a good place for product. On the community side, I'm all about finding individuals to join the insiders program as you've heard me mention. Why? Because right now, if you go across all of our channels, we have 30 or 40,000 members.


### 00:25:00

Adam Wozney: And me as a solo kind of professional community manager, it's impossible for me to have calls and talks with all those individuals. So I depend on people funneling themselves and self-identifying and say I want to get involved and that limits the amount of people I can interact with daily because I talking to 30,000 plus people is just impossible. So shrinking that number down into individuals that are saying, "Hey, I want to get involved and they've gone through a process.  I can actually work with them and do things with them and support them in better ways than I could on a grand scale of 30 or 40,000 individuals. So, for me personally, I really want people to apply to join the insiders program. I want to support those folks and get them involved in different ways. and I want to see if there's things that we can do to kind of better support what they're doing outside of Akos.

Adam Wozney: I look at the insiders program as a way to support the Akos ecosystem because whatever is beneficial for a cash is just a beneficial across the board but I don't want people to join just to be aos I don't know freaks I'm more than just a kosh what I mean I want to find things I want to put in programs and initiatives that can help individuals grow on a personal and a professional

Adam Wozney: level and I look to implement initiatives that are yes beneficial to AOS but I know can be beneficial to anyone that's participating in them for the long term. so that's kind of how I think about it from my community perspective but on the Akos kind of product perspective I say the best place to go is just check out the road map and see if there's ways you can get involved there and work with core engineering folks on that.

Germany Beal: All right. Sounds

Adam Wozney: other than that, I already mentioned so I will be going on my own dime to Dev Connect next week. I'm very excited for that. I will be representing AOSH. I have a pan handful of things that I'm attending and participating in, which I will be tweeting out later today. So, go and check those things out. If you're attending Dev Connect, let me know. Would love to meet up. the only other big event that's coming up is Nurups, It's a machine learning conference.  It'll be our final kind of big to-do event of the year. Amanda's done a great job of planning a working space. there's going to be coffee trucks. There's a bunch of different ways developers and machine learning professionals of note can participate in AOS activities. So, I'm sure we'll have more to report once that's all completed in early December. But other than that, that's it for my updates. next on the agenda is Germany, you said you had a status update on the project you're working on.

Germany Beal: All right, there we go. Sorry, I was muted. yes. I am. So, just to give everyone a community service update, we unfortunately didn't get the second proposal. Granted, we were really close to it. There was some things that we couldn't control, which is, some of the validators decided to swap at the last minute, but that's mine.  But with that being said, yeah, we're still currently building on top of Akos and we actually have a couple projects that have been deployed using the framework and that's been generating I forgot the numbers.

Germany Beal: I was supposed to have it during this call but walking and taking this call at the same time but yeah it's been generating not a crazy amount but definitely it increase the volume of people using some of the GPUs as well as the inflining infrastructure which is pretty good. we did as a team decide to move forward to just completing milestone 2. from what it sounds like you guys are kind of going lean yeah since you guys are from what it sounds like or overclock labs is going lean.

Germany Beal: we might like either just wait to resubmit the proposal or maybe talk with some of the overall subs team in the back end to see how can we collab and work together still. But that u we've been having some people or we've been drumming up interest whether it's from consumers on one of the apps that's been deployed as well as from builders as well. So yeah, so I think all in all it's like going real well, but other than that, yeah, I just want to give you guys an update on that. And yeah, that's it.

Adam Wozney: Thank you, Germany. And is there any way for folks on this call can support or get involved in kind of what you're working on?

Germany Beal: Yeah, I mean obviously just reach out any help is really good.

Germany Beal: The main thing that ideally we will still like to look forward to is just more like validator support in the governance system which we can't control but we'll see. But yeah, you have a project that would access to the repo and play around experiment please reach out I'm Germany in the discord so it's pretty if you watch anime I have the tanguro photo.  Yeah, feel free to reach out and if you want to build then reach out, let us know and we'll give you the playbyplay on how to get set up.

Adam Wozney: Thank you, Germany, and thank you for all the work you're doing on that. Yeah, I know things we're at a very interesting time in the world of AOS. So, I appreciate all the stuff that you're doing to kind of introduce folks and benefit the ecosystem. So, big shout out. cool. I think that's really all I have on the agenda.  The last thing I just wanted to say was if you guys do have any thoughts, feedback, comments on anything across related, product, on anything at all, head into the SIG community channel and leave your thoughts there. next community call is going to be in December, the final one of the year. Hopefully I have some fun updates there. but other than that, that's really all I got today, guys.

Adam Wozney: Any other thoughts, comments before we wrap up today's call? And I can go grab lunch. All right. I Thank you for joining on the 12th of November, 2025.
