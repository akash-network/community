## Transcript


### 00:08:02

  \
**Joe Deng:** All right, and we are recording. Welcome everybody to SIG community. Today is February 10th and uh yeah, welcome everybody to our SIG. So I suppose we should get started. Uh so I'm going to run by a few updates for everybody just to tell the community what we've been up to and what kind of programs we've been running as well as uh what is upcoming in terms of test nets and things like that that I'm hoping for a big show show of uh community uh in the near future. So uh let's get started with Akash club itself first. So Akash club uh officially started in January. So, it's been about a month and in that month we've been able to successfully run four events. So, we're trying to average about one event a week uh all things considered. And uh this month we ran four events as promised. We did Akashion 2026 which is a road mapap look and a deep dive into what's coming up and how we're solving the challenges that Akash is going through today and how we are going to try and ship all these uh features to improve upon the situation right uh following that we had a club game night where we just you know just had some fun and tried to get a little bit more of a casual meetup between the community members and I'm really hoping that we are going to see more um interest in that right uh \
  \
 


### 00:09:36

  \
**Joe Deng:** so really really gauging upon it I'll talk a little bit more about that in just a second then uh we also did a market thesis of Akash where we went over all of the macro that is happening macro in terms of what's happening in the greater environment that we have uh with political I guess uh tenability for data centers going down with a a big increase of grassroots uh protesting and uh opposition against data centers in general and how all of that will mean more of a chance for Akash to steal the show and provide energy solutions um or rather solutions to the energy problems that the world is experiencing today. And then just last week we had our deep dive into the Burn mint equilibrium module that is coming on to Akash. And I want to say I don't know when final release is going to be, but you know the test net is coming out sometime this week. And so we're going to move forward and talk about that in the next slides. And so for anybody within our community that are unable to get to our events live, no worries. \
  \
 


### 00:10:47

  \
**Joe Deng:** There is always a recording of some sort that you can refer to at the end. And so I've left a lot of the the links directly here on this slide. So, if you if anybody is interested in kind of catching up on what they missed out on, you can easily just uh go ahead and take a look at that. And I I will note that each one of these um videos will come with the quiz that you can take at the end to really encourage people to participate and watch it, of course, watch our work, watch our events, and uh enter our monthly raffle. Okay. So, I'm gonna leave that on for just one more second and then I'm going to move on to the next page. So, the next event that we're having, which is this Friday, is going to be a networking event, a meetup event. So, it's again somewhat of more casual setting just to meet all everybody within our community and and integrate and hopefully make some connections there. Uh we really want to get involved with the club planning. \
  \
 


### 00:11:49

  \
**Joe Deng:** So sometimes we'll have different things in terms of opinions and and where we should go next because a kosh club is really a community program that's built for the community. Uh so I would really like to tap into the community as to what you guys are looking for as opposed as to what I can direct. Of course, myself as the community manager, I am more than happy to go ahead and produce uh events for everybody, but I think it is going to be much more impactful if people get involved and talk about what it is that they want to see more of. So, for example, Open Claw is been a very big uh I guess uh viral thing that's happening in the AI world today. If you guys want to see more events based on that, we have to, you know, let us know and then I will plan for it, right? Uh the last thing I want to do is really make presentations and produce events that are less than interesting to our community and so hence uh really looking forward to getting some feedback from you guys wherever possible in whatever form. \
  \
 


### 00:12:53

  \
**Joe Deng:** You know, I'm available on Discord, I'm available during the events, after the events, uh and anywhere in between. you can most likely find me available somewhere. So if you have some suggestions, some ideas, some wishes that you want, I would would love to see you guys there. Uh and then also on this meetup, so once a month we're going to have these casual meetups at the very least once a month. Uh and during these events is where we're we are going to run our raffles. And so this coming event is going to be where we're going to do our community raffle as well. So, you know, show up and, you know, you could be a winner, too. And just as a reminder, how we get raffle tickets throughout the month is really just show up to events and you will get a uh participation credit in in the form of a raffle ticket. Um, you know, watch our recaps and take the quizzes and once again, you'll get a participation uh raffle to do that. And then, of course, you know, come and sometimes we'll have these game nights like we did last month. \
  \
 


### 00:13:54

  \
**Joe Deng:** win some games, you know, beat out your fellow community members and, you know, win additional entries and whatnot. So, a lot of these raffles are really just uh as a show of thanks to our community uh you know, for being a part of it and and participating with us and so I really look forward to having more of these. Uh I left the link for you guys to either you know QR QR code scan your way in or you can always type in the link to RSVP to our next event. and I hope that I will see many of you there. Uh the last thing I'll say about these events in terms of the four events that we had, what I've noticed so far is that a lot of the deep dive content that we've been doing, a lot of people show up for it. They're really interested. So what it tells me is that uh any feature deep dives or any uh you know in-depth explanations of concepts that you know that Kosh utilizes is popular enough to have a lot of participants show up. \
  \
 


### 00:14:52

  \
**Joe Deng:** And then when it comes to some of the softer items like the game nights and possibly this coming meetups, I've seen a little uh lowered participation or lowered interest, you know, and and once again, a lot of this is, you know, takes time and effort to build up. So if it if you see something that you like, I really highly encourage you show up to these events and or at least like uh give words of encouragement because if I if myself or any of the Akash Club admin members feel like there's not a lot of um interest in some of these events, we might opt not to do them. Uh because at the end of the day, we're all here. We all have things to do and we really want to, you know, safeguard our productivity to work for the community the best that we can. So, if these are events that are not that interesting at the moment, we might table them for later. Uh, a good example is I usually try to do one in-depth uh like a deep dive and then in between that have a more casual event. \
  \
 


### 00:15:46

  \
**Joe Deng:** Um, but last week we just skipped over the game night and went straight to yet another uh uh deep dive event. And so, it's just something to keep in mind. Sorry, I'm gonna close my door in a sec so my dogs don't bark. Can you close the door for me? Thank you. All right, perfect. Um, yeah, so that's just a note there. Moving on to the next slide. So, I wanted to give a short update on the community bounty programs that we are having. Uh, so these have been uh worked on by myself and by Pyber who's not here, Ben. He's been working hard on producing these uh bounties for the community to uh take on because a lot of the work that we do in our community, we really want to encourage our community members to contribute. This is an open source network and we are allow for open source uh and open contributions and so we really want to encourage that. So in terms of the community uh where the bounces are going to be, we are in the process of remaking the page for our community. \
  \
 


### 00:16:53

  \
**Joe Deng:** And this is going to be at the akash.network officially uh redone to include my new programs, particularly a Akash club, the new Akash insiders, things like that. And with that package is going to be an update to the bounty board uh that we're going to put onto the website directly so that more participants can you know get to see and get to uh get involved and make it easier to get involved as well. So Ben and I are currently working on what the process is to basically apply for bounties, whether or not it's going to be a sign up form, whether it's a show up at Discord and let us know. We'll figure all of that out before the release of the of the of the bounty board. And I'm really hoping for the release to come out sometime next week. Um, but fingers crossed because we're really uh hoping on the work and productivity of the website team and they've been slammed with quite a bit of updates. So, we'll we'll see how it goes. Uh in terms of the bounty program itself, uh we're working on three subsections to it that we think is going to be uh appreciated by community over the next let's say quarter. \
  \
 


### 00:17:59

  \
**Joe Deng:** And so in this way we are currently working on the content and guide requests. So Rodri who is on this call right now has actually done quite a few guides already and he's continuing to do more every week. uh we have newcomers like Sandeep who is uh looking to assist as well with producing useful guides and so these guides can come in many forms. It could be directed by myself. So for example and I'll show in the next slide we have a kind of a preview of what the bounties might look like. So you know in that way it might be directed by myself where I'm like hey we need a open claw you know guide and whatnot. So I need someone to deploy the open claw on console walk through it and do a written guide. It could be like that. It can come in the form of your own ideas. So in this case made a uh walkthrough of Reddus which is a a data database uh you know intensive um deployment. And so you know it goes both ways. \
  \
 


### 00:18:57

  \
**Joe Deng:** It can either be from me it could be from you guys. I actually prefer it if it comes from the community because if it's something that you're excited to do, uh I had another insider that was working on an agent zero implementation and he was working on uh possibly putting that template up on Akash and as well as writing a guide. So those are more exciting things that I am um interested in because I I love producing the ideas but what I love more is to uh emboden you guys to empower you guys to produce those ideas that you're interested in and have that uploaded to the greater Akash community overall. Um so yeah uh so the next slides gonna next few slides going to show a little bit about the bounty updates. So, sorry, bounty previews and so you guys can kind of get an idea of it. Uh, everything is in process. Everything is never set in stone until it's up on a website and officially released, but I just wanted to give you a preview. Anyway, uh, in terms of the two remaining items that are coming soon is going to be our viod app builds as well as our community affiliates. \
  \
 


### 00:20:00

  \
**Joe Deng:** So, just a quick rundown of them because uh, you know, I think more details will come out as we develop it over the next few months. So the vibe coder apps is a initiative to encourage more people to build on Akash right that's why we want to show off the capabilities we want to show off Akash ML that allows us to plug in that those open model brains into any of our applications that we're going to be vi coding uh and so we want to kind of put that in action and so I'm going to be hopefully providing a list of good vibe coded vibecoded app ideas as well as requests from the community any other ideas that you guys might have and the whole purpose of it is really just to deploy something and show and hopefully we are fingers crossed that these apps are going to be somewhat viral and then people can then deploy their own version. So uh good example would be let's say I we are making a podcast right and this is being released by the core team as an example. \
  \
 


### 00:20:57

  \
**Joe Deng:** So, the core team's working on a podcasting uh automated podcasting system where it every day it'll grab like the top five winners and losers of of the stock market, right? And write up a a quick synopsis of those 10 stocks and then produce a podcast from that content, right? So, there's many moving pieces. You can imagine we're grabbing real-time data. We're producing from an LLM the content and then we are putting on top a podcasting feel to it. So, we're going to do text to speech and and basically you can see how many different models are going to be put together to produce uh a podcast like that on the daily. And so, that's going to be what's released by the official team. But then, for example, you might want to deploy your own and instead of stocks, we can talk about the top 10 cryptos or the top 10 uh whatever it is, top 10 sneakers that you know, whatever your topic is. we can basically have that as a template and deployed for a totally different set of circumstances, a totally different set of topics. \
  \
 


### 00:22:01

  \
**Joe Deng:** And so you can kind of see how a viod app over here can spawn additional apps that are on a kosh, right? Powered by a kosh um and to be more tailored to the individual, right? So it could be a learning app, you know, let's say we did a dual lingual learning app and and there we can we can change it up and learn different languages instead, you know. Um I think that that all that will be helpful. Uh all right. And then the last part is going to be community affiliates. And so for community affiliates, it's a very simple really looking forward to producing a new version of the Akash Navigators, which back in the day was very volunteer-based and uh and the purpose of the Navigators was really to go and u outreach to different companies that might be interested in migrating their workloads to Akash. Um hold on one second. And uh yeah, and so what we're really hoping for is to get the help of the community to go ahead and um and go out and do that outreach, right? \
  \
 


### 00:23:10

  \
**Joe Deng:** And the the point that I'm thinking about right now, again, this program is very new, is that we will do something along the lines of um you know, we can have community who's going to be trained. So there's going to be a bit of a of a onboarding. And after a while, after that onboarding, you guys can go and reach out to different companies, smaller companies, right, who are maybe utilizing AI features that we can help with Akash ML or we can help with deployed on Akash. And so reaching out to those companies and kind of warming up the lead and then really it's not a sales position. So we're not expecting anyone to go out and sell Akash, but it's so much just to get the interest high enough to then pass that along to myself. uh which I can then take the call myself or I can pass along to the head of sales. Uh either or uh but the idea is really just to get the community involved in growing the uh the revenue on our network as well as the amount of customers and businesses that are using us. \
  \
 


### 00:24:09

  \
**Joe Deng:** Right? So really looking forward to include you guys in that initiative. And of course we'll be paying out bounties for a lot of these uh a lot of this work. Right. Uh any questions you can feel free to type it in or we can save it to the end. But I'm just going to move on to uh previews of some of the bounties. And so again, not everything is set in stone, but the idea is that just to give an idea of what type of uh you know things that you can look up look forward to. So in this case, we're having basic blog articles that talk about the difference between Akash and other competitors in the space. Uh we also have news reports which I think is going to be pretty interesting. Um so a lot of the Akash uh event budget is now being shifted away from let's say big conferences uh you know crypto conferences and whatnot into more AI focused uh either AI focused uh conferences like Europe's or uh to hackathons that we're doing. \
  \
 


### 00:25:08

  \
**Joe Deng:** So you'll see that Akash be starting to participate in a lot of hackathons. Uh the whole point is really to get builders to build on Akash, right? Really to show off what we are capable of. And so that is great for the people, let's say the 50, 100 people that are in the hackathons, but for the rest of us, we don't really see what's going on. So I thought it would be a great idea for our community to write up little articles, little excerpts, highlight the winners, see what the winners are building and what they did to win the prize, so to speak, and uh and share it with everybody else, right? because the idea is to really show uh the world, you know, outside world outside of this community what Akasha is capable of. And so that's really the purpose of those news reports. I think the blog articles are pretty self-explanatory just the differences. They're nuanced differences between let's say AOS and render, but still there's a lot of people out there right now that don't really understand differences. \
  \
 


### 00:26:01

  \
**Joe Deng:** They figured they're both GPUs, they're both AI focused, you know, and whatnot. And so we really need to, you know, as the compute space becomes more and more crowded, we really need to carve out our own individual niche and style and the, you know, feature sets that, you know, that are important to our our clients and customers, right? Um, on the next slide, I have, you know, the second part of the of the bounty previews, which really shows off other types of bounties that you can expect, you know, in the near future. things like video guides, you know, when we're deploying things, when we're doing uh different uh items and whatnot, right? So, some of these will be, you know, named out exactly what you need to do. So, the expectation is if you take up some of these bounties, you're going to work in conjunction with myself or somebody within the Akash Club admin team to really vet out like what the um the content is going to be. So nobody's going to really like make an article, publish it and and and and and that's it. \
  \
 


### 00:27:04

  \
**Joe Deng:** You know, it's more likely to be make an outline, you know, run it by one of us, then we'll give give tips and pointers, you know, really here to support to make the best content available uh so that you can have the best effect for your contributions, right? And then of course for our technical-minded folks, there are going to be a lot of PRs uh so a lot of like documentation to write or or issues to fix on our repo and all of that will be available as well as it comes. And so for this section of it, you know, I believe that there are going to be a good amount of issues, but not all of the issues are going to be solvable by our community. And that's why we are going to supplement that with what I said about vibe coding bounties as well as um affiliate bounties as well so that we can get you know I'm hoping for something for everybody you know and I'm trying my best to include everybody that is currently within our community set uh to be able to contribute some way some form with whatever skills that might that might be available. \
  \
 


### 00:28:08

  \
**Joe Deng:** Oops. Uh sorry I pushed the wrong button. Um, all right. So, I guess over here I'm going to take a break real quick. Any questions, you know, so far in regards to um the events that we're running and the um and the bounty system that we're looking to implement before we uh move on to BME. Going once, going twice. All right, we'll keep moving then. Uh so the next part that we're really hoping for a lot of community involvement is going to be our incentivized test net. So as I heard the latest information is that we should expect some sort of update, some sort of release this coming Thursday. And so that's two days away. Um but you don't have to wait. If you guys are interested in kind of looking into when incentivized, not when I just told you Thursday is about the expected date for it to be released. But if you want to get a heads up, a quick start, you can always go ahead and look at the test steps that is already currently on the website. \
  \
 


### 00:29:13

  \
**Joe Deng:** I did a little bit of a screenshot for you guys here. So, if you go to docs.Akash.network, scroll all the way to the bottom on the left hand side, you'll see, you know, the test steps. And so you can get a preview into seeing what is expected of you during uh this incentivized test net um to see if you're interested in joining or not, right? Uh and just so I to be clear and I know some of you guys are already part of the insider testing that we're doing right now. Um, for those of you that are, and I see Fennel, Rodri, you know, uh, Phoebe, you know, a few of you are, uh, I will say that we will be requesting that you, uh, go ahead and be available to assist newcomers into, uh, you know, getting the right things done for their test apps as well, which means that if you're a newcomer, not only do you have the test steps ahead of time, but you can also expect uh, some support from our Vanguards and from our insiders that are already doing the testing. \
  \
 


### 00:30:10

  \
**Joe Deng:** So, I think that that should, you know, in my hopes make it a easier time, uh, more enjoyable time as you go ahead and try to break the BME module. And really, you know, and if you do break it, I think there are additional prizes to to be had really. Uh because at the end of the day what we really want is we really want to bulletproof this uh to to make it so that you know all attack attack vectors are thought of u to really make sure that we can um submit this to live production and not have it worried about you know messing up our economy in some shape or form. So uh you know thank you ahead of time for those of you that are going to be joining the test net. you know, really can't do it without you um to to take in your ideas on that. Okay. And uh that's it for me in terms of new updates for the community. Uh again, I'll open the floor out to any questions. \
  \
 


### 00:31:09

  \
**Joe Deng:** If you guys have any uh or any suggestions as well or if you have a suggestion on what to look forward to in terms of the club events or things like that, go ahead and let me know. I will have the floor to you now. Sandep you are not muted. \
**Sandeep:** Yeah. Uh so how many how many days this incentivized test net is going to be? \
**Joe Deng:** Sorry, I can't repeat again. What about test \
**Sandeep:** like uh currently we are uh we have started this test net incentivized BME test net uh \
**Joe Deng:** net? \
**Sandeep:** testing right so uh how many days it's going to be there you know uh in this testing \
**Joe Deng:** Oh, \
**Sandeep:** phase \
**Joe Deng:** great question. Uh, I should have actually mentioned that when I was talking when I was talking about it. It will there's actually going to be uh it's probably going to run about two weeks. So two to three weeks is the number that I'm getting. So uh again more details will come out once it's officially officially released. \
  \
 


### 00:32:09

  \
**Joe Deng:** Um but the expectation is it's going to run at least two weeks maybe running into three. So I think that that should be plenty of time for um people to run through the test the test steps. Yep. Any other questions, guys? Okay. Um, I'll take this opportunity to apologize for the noise. My house is being cleaned right now and so there's a bit of vacuuming in the back. I hope that's uh not not too apparent being picked up by my mic here. So, yeah. Okay. All right, guys. Uh I mean, if you guys don't have any more questions, I'm more than happy to give you your time back. Um once again, you can always find me. Yeah. \
**Rodri R:** Hey. \
**Joe Deng:** Oh, yeah. Rodri, \
**Rodri R:** Uh, \
**Joe Deng:** that's right. \
**Rodri R:** we we need \
**Joe Deng:** Rodri has a uh has a raffle to give out uh for the \
**Rodri R:** to \
**Joe Deng:** Zeli program, I believe. So, we are What \
  \
 


### 00:33:10

  \
**Rodri R:** It's actually three three contest raffles. \
**Joe Deng:** happened? \
**Rodri R:** It's three contest raffles. \
**Joe Deng:** Oh, three contest raffles. All right. This is uh this is going to be exciting. \
**Rodri R:** Yeah. \
