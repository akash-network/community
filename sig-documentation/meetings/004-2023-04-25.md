## Notes

 - **Docs 2.0 migration progress [86](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/86)**: Tyler Wright mentioned that a demo should be available in around two weeks.
 - **New documentation**: Benjamin mentioned that he is working on documentation related to automation. Scott Carruthers mentions that documentation related to testnets, such as the [GPU documentation for providers](https://docs.akash.network/other-resources/experimental/testnet/provider-build-with-gpu), has been released.
 - **Akash Console documentation**: a repository is now available for console under [akash-network/console](https://github.com/akash-network/console), and another documentation related to it can be found on these two links: [akash-network/docs](https://github.com/akash-network/docs) and [Akash Console documentation](https://docs.akash.network/guides/deploy).

### Action Items

 - **New documentation**: if you have any documentation that you want to create, you can get involved in the [sig-docs Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/747885925232672829/1062752266991456278) by asking whether or not a document is created or should be created.
 - **Akash Console documentation**: Tyler Wright mentions that documentation related to Akash Console is needed. If you feel like you can help with this, write in the [akash-console Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/747885925232672829/1053359341144653957) on Discord.
 - **For next meeting**: we should have a larger meeting related to the progress of Docs 2.0, where participants can share feedback related to structure and design direction.
