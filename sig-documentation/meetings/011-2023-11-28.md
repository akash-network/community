- Scott has been actively involved in both support and documentation to ensure the shared information aligns with community needs.
- The group aims to broaden the community effort in tackling documentation, encouraging more participation in creating and revising documentation.
- Recent discussions have centered around "Docs 2.0," an initiative to further enhance the structure of documentation. Scott has played a pivotal role in managing this initiative, supported by other team members.
- Tyler shared positive progress, noting contributions from community members, including insiders and vanguards, particularly focused on Leap Wallet documentation.
- Emphasis on ongoing efforts to encourage more contributions from the community.
- Introduction of documentation bounties as an incentive for community members interested in contributing.
- Details to be clarified in the coming week, with a clear explanation provided in the Akash network documentation repository.
- Operational process outlined: Open contributions will be reviewed by the core team for functionality and checked for typos. Approved pull requests (PRs) will be merged, and contributors will receive payouts.
- Tyler emphasized the need to fine-tune the process for clarity, with details to be documented in the repository.
- Planning for the next steps involving key members attending the meeting, who have shown interest in contributing to documentation.
- Aim to collaborate on laying out the specifics and next steps for community involvement.
### Discussions on Merging Technical and Developer-Focused Documentation
##### Tyler Wright: 
- Tyler provided an update on the website and documentation page, [sharing a link](https://akash-network.vercel.app/docs) to the staging website for the community to review.
- Structural changes discussed in previous Sig Documentation and Docs 2.0 meetings have been implemented by Scott, Luna, and other community members.
-  Piyush and his team at Human HQ are actively involved in migrating documentation to the updated URL (akash.network/docs).
- Design decisions for the docs on the website are still pending, and a link to the staging website was shared for participants to review.
- Stakeholders were expected to discuss design decisions during the meeting, but due to their absence, a follow-up conversation will be scheduled.
- Two distinct user experience items discussed:
  - Documentation for users interacting with Akash Network (deployment, becoming a provider, validation, etc.).
  - Engineering documentation for those building applications and contributing to the core code base.
- Challenge identified in merging technical engineering documentation with user-focused documentation.
- Participants encouraged to brainstorm and share thoughts in the Sig Documentation Discord Channel for follow-up discussions.
### Layout of Specific Documentation (Docs 2.0)
##### Tyler Wright: 
- Tyler introduced the second point of conversation, focusing on the layout of specific documentation on the website.
- Noted that there was a previous agreement on the structure during Docs 2.0 discussions, but there seems to be differing opinions as the website revamp progresses.
- Described the historical changes: from long continuous pages, to steps and sub-pages, and the potential thought of returning to longer scroll pages with a side menu.
- Raised two user experience items for discussion:
   - Long Continuous Scroll: A single long page with steps, using a side menu for navigation.
   - Step-by-Step Pages: Each step on a separate page, as currently implemented.
