## Meeting Notes

### **Introduction and Purpose**
- Amanda Keay introduced the first events working group meeting of 2025.
- These monthly meetings aim to:
  - Provide transparency into event planning.

### **Budget Adjustments**
- **Reduction of Tier 3 Events**
  - Originally planned 13 events; tier three events have been cut.
  - This removes close to $200,000 from the budget.
  - Decision made to shift focus toward developer engagement rather than sending small teams to global events (e.g., Dubai, Singapore).
  - Instead of funding travel for three-person teams at these events, funds will be used for developer-centric initiatives, including:
    - San Francisco-based developer events.
    - Focused hackathons.
    - Expanding Akash console deployments.
  - Amanda will update the proposal document with these changes for transparency.

## **Transcript**

Amanda Keay: All right. thank you guys for attending our first of the year events working group meeting. I wanted to start doing these.  I know Adam I think has done them in the past, but I wanted to just for the community be available for questions for sharing what goes on at conferences, ways that you can get involved and a little bit of what Overclock has planned for the 2025 event season. So, I guess I will start off with that. I'll give an overview.

Amanda Keay: some of you are already familiar about the prop that went live a couple weeks ago and then the discussion that was in December. we had 13 events that were slated. since then, as of last week, we have decided to cut all of the tier three events from the budget. So, that's going to remove close to $200,000.  And our goal, the reason for cutting those events, number one, tier three events were supposed to be a rather small group of people attending the events, up to three people. And we decided that instead of allotting that money to just send three people to an event, which could be in Dubai or Singapore, and spending so much money for just two days, we letting someone in.

Amanda Keay: we wanted to instead focus our efforts a little bit more directly for developers and for just tech startups in the space. So what we're trying to do is we're going to take that close to $200,000 and we're going to just specifically do some events that are going to be like I said more geared towards the developers.  So some events in SF some really focused hackathons that we're planning to do in the space with the goal of introducing a kosh to people and having those deployments on console.

Amanda Keay: So that's kind of the highlevel overview of what the little bit of shift I will be updating and probably adding a comment in the prop so that everyone is aligned with any questions about that shift in some of the event schedule.

Rodri R: Here makes sense.

Amanda Keay: Okay, cool. I'll go through and kind of give just a really quick overview of the event schedule for 2025. we kind of have a balance. So, we're going to heavily do two big events, East Denver and Nvidia GTC in quarter 1. Those are February and March. those are going to be our tier one budgeted events. We have a big booth. Greg is doing multiple talks.

Amanda Keay: we have multiple side events that we're going to be participating in. community members are going to be flying out. Budget for seven to eight people. So those are our bigger events. That's going to be in the middle of the year, so it's the end of quarter two we're going to be doing a kosh accelerate again. That's going to bump up right next to permissionless.  So it'll kind of go right into last year it was accelerate into consensus. This year it's going to be permissionless since it's in New York. so we're going to do our big AOS accelerate in Brooklyn in June. And then at the end of the year we have token 2049 in Singapore and Nurup's which we did last year. It was in Vancouver. This year it's going to be in Adam's neck of the woods down in San Diego.

Amanda Keay: So, that's kind of the balance. So, we have two one in the middle, two at the end. And what we're going to do in between is, load up with hackathons, attending AI tech week startup things in San Francisco, utilizing our space in Austin to bring in hackathons and community meetups and developers to come and work in the space and get connected there. So, that's kind of the focus right now.

Amanda Keay: We are still planning to attend Cosmoverse and Cosmoverse that wasn't listed. That's going to be I think in quarter three. So, we still have plans to attend that as but that's kind of the balance of the events right now. And then the middle times where we're not doing these big builtout events, we're going to be filling in with hackathons that the community or Adam is going to do. We're going to do similar to what the AOS

Amanda Keay: What was the name of it? Akashathon.


### 00:05:00

Rodri R: A kashan.

Amanda Keay: Akashathon. That's right. similar to what the Aashathon, we'll do some inperson hackathons, that sort of thing. So that's our goal. And it's not really going to affect the total budget number. by removing those tier three events, the total of them came to what like I said, just under $200,000. and we'll be using that money to fund the hackathons and do those events. And of course, anything that we don't use will be put back into the community pool. and we'll be very transparent about all of that as well. So, any questions or anything that you would like to see us do or anything that you'd like to get involved with ideas, be happy to write them down and talk through them as well.

Amanda Keay: Sure, Rodri.

Rodri R: So nothing in Europe I believe this year.

Amanda Keay: Nothing As of right now, I mean, ETHC was going to be a tier three event. I That might change though. like I said like we have that budget and if there's something that looks like it's going to be an opportunity for us to connect with startups and developers that are looking to deploy on Akos then that's something that we'll definitely be considering. it's kind of up in the air. We're leaving that those times a little bit open to determine and where the most deployments will come from.

Amanda Keay: But by all means, if you are looking to attend a conference and represent Akos, definitely feel free to grab a ticket or try to swing over there. any questions about Denver and Invidia GTC? Those are the two that I can probably share the most on right now. I've been working pretty much non-stop on those. if not, I'll just kind of blab and share what I have. so we have a 10 by20 booth. I think Adam shared in an insider community call. we have a pretty awesome builtout booth with custom clouds to create this super cloud effect in our booth as well as big signage.

Amanda Keay: and we're going to have a whole slew of different merchandise that we're going to be giving away and also connecting with people there on the ground. Greg has two talks, one during Biddle week and one during the main event. Adam is going to be moderating like four different panels throughout the week. I know Zach is I think jumping on a panel or two. we're connecting with some local communities that Adam is working on right now and just different side events that people have been hitting me up with to see if we can participate or talk at a different events. So that's what's going to be happening for East Denver.

Amanda Keay: we are doing one side event right now and that's going to be on the 27th and I'm trying to think what else for that week. and then it's three days of the booth. So, we have a builtout booth schedule for that for that whole time and for everyone that's going to be attending. with a bunch of I think there's already a thousand side events already. It's crazy. and then a couple weeks later, Nvidia GTC is going to be in San Jose. we're finalizing the booth right now and Greg has two talks there. One's like an on demand talk which I'm not really sure what that's going to look like if it's going to be video recorded or what that's still TBD. his other talk is going to be actually on the NVIDIA stage and that's going to be on the 19th in the afternoon. So hoping to get some really good content out of that. So yeah, super excited about that.

Amanda Keay: we are going to be doing a side event. I'm working right now to try to find a really special partner to partner with us so we can draw a really good crowd on the 18th of March. Greg is also hosting a VIP dinner that week, so that is going to be set up as well. So, super excited about both of those conferences. I've never been to NVIDI GTC.  I know some people from our team were there last year. I think we shared a brev booth. So excited to participate in that space especially with all the hype of AI right now and all the new chips that Nvidia just talked about. And then that's kind of where my planning has I mean and then all the logistics around all those things.


### 00:10:00

Amanda Keay: But any questions? Nope, not yet. That's okay. it was mostly just me sharing information. I don't have to take up all of the 30 minutes an hour that I have allotted, but wanted to keep you guys in the loop as far as what there's been just a few changes with the event schedule.  But we'll definitely be talking with Adam and updating those community what's it called? The request forms if you wanted to come to a conference. So we'll be removing the events that were not necessarily attending updating them and then we'll share that all that with you guys in Discord. If no one else has any questions then I will end early.

Amanda Keay: But I plan on doing an event. I can probably shorten them to about 30 minutes for next month. so I plan on doing these once probably the third week or fourth week of each month and just try to update the community and get feedback and give updates on events that we were just at. So hopefully the next one will be right I think it'll actually be right before ETH Denver. So we'll probably have more to share then. But if no one has any questions, I will let you guys take back your calendar time and hope you have a great week. I look forward to seeing you at the insider community call tomorrow. Peace. Stay warm.

Jannick H: Byebye.

Amanda Keay: Have a great week everybody. See you.
