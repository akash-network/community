## Participants



## Notes:

- Anil reviewed the structure of the meeting for any new members.
- Anil started the meeting by asking if there any feedback on how things are going in the community or any grievances? 
- There was no feedback from the community.
- Anil talked about the Projects list.
- Greg talked about Mainnet 6. This is a huge update for Akash.
- Anil mentioned that ZJ was able to deploy SDXL. Shoutout ZJ!
- Greg reiterated this fact, and made it clear that the Passage investment was from Overclock Labs.
- Passage will be a big user for Akash, and they are doing a lot of work.
- Sigs and Wgs coming up next week include sig-economics, sig-support, sig-chain, and others. Stay tuned in discord to stay up to date. 


### Projects:

- GPU Incentivized Testnet ended a week ago.
- There are a few technical issues that are covered in sig-support. The issues are 104 and 106.
- After testing out these issues, there will be a testnet for take pay and stable payments. These things will be figured out in the next few weeks.
- Max aske if take pay will be before or after the Mainnet. All the changes to GPUs and take pay will happen before the Mainnet.
- Mainnet Upgrade is tracking for the first or second week of August, depending on testing.
- Anil talked about the hackathon and the events which are getting a lot of work right now.
- Luna spoke about EthParis.
- Anil mentioned that they are talking to a team working on decentralized internet project that wants to be apart of the Akash Hackathon.
- Anil talked about documentation site. Luna and his team are working on docs 2.0.
- Scott from Overclock Labs has been working on developer documentation.
- Anil talked about analytics. Overclock is talking with Cloudmos about analytics. Zack is working on analytics for the entire Cosmos, including Akash. 
- Max and team are working on a schema for provider attributes. Anil has a spec that he is working on. Feel free to give feedback on this.
- Max made a PR for the schema today. Here is the [PR](https://github.com/maxmaxlabs/cloudmos-config/pull/1). The main goal is to have a base schema that can evolve over time.
- Anil talked about AuthZ. There are two sides of this. Cloudmos team is going to work on AuthZ after provider attributes.
- Anil mentioned that Overclock Labs and Cloudmos are talking about sharing code. This code would be in AkashJs. The conversations are early.
- Anil talked about content moderation. This was on pause from the Praetor team, while they focused on GPU Testnet.
- Jigar mentioned that after providers are stable on Mainnet
- Most of the work for GO Client Library is pending to wait for discussion, and waiting for the Mainnet to happen.
- Artur mentioned that there is a delay on his side to review code. There are some things that need to be addressed before moving on.
- Anil reiterated that GPUs and Mainnet take priority right now.
- Anil wanted to plant a seed about a few things.
   - There has been discussion of trying to figure out a SPOT marketplace for GPUs and CPUs. Many of the workloads are batchy in nature, so resources are utilized for only part of the day. The thesis is that companies can bring supply onto the market while they are not using it. In order for this to work, there needs to be a few changes. Need to make sure that inventory removable at certains times does NOT affect uptime. Also need to figure out how this will all work from a logistical standpoint to user experience optimization.
   - As part of the GPU AI Incentivized Testnet, it has been important to find supply and demand. There are some tenants that have been identified that will be paired with providers. There is a thought to start a project to test AI foundational models.
   - Greg mentioned that there is a notion that decentralized networks cannot Train a model. If we can prove that wrong, that would be great for web 3 in general. The whole process will be documented to share the story with others. It will be incredibly helpful for Akash, and will help build tools for improving the experience. 

### Github Discussions:

- Anil talked about discussions around analytics.
- Boz mentioned that John has to update this proposal based upon Akash's needs.
- Cheng put in a proposal for inflation pool, and this has since passed on chain [here https://www.mintscan.io/akash/proposals/211.
- Boz and Anil will look at the discussion from Weco [here](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/276).
- Boz will respond to the person about building a Delegation platform in the discussion here: https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/280.
- Many people mentioned that mintscan version 2.0 is very nice. 


**Open Discussion:**

- Andrew asked about Passage investment announcement. This was funded by Overclock Labs; not the Akash Network.
  
### Action Items:

- Luna will turn the docs site back on for Greg to give feedback.
- Artur to review code for GO Client Libraries.
- Anil will pusblish a discussion with next steps after meeting with the team for training an AI model on Akash.
