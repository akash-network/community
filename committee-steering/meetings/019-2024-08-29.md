### Akash Project Boards
#### Community and Marketing Initiatives
- Amanda Keay provided updates on recent events:
  - Akash was the lead sponsor for the Cosmo Verse event in Buenos Aires, where the team was able to connect with local developers and promote Akash as a provider.
  - Upcoming major conferences include Korea Blockchain Week, Token 2049, Mainnet in New York, and Cosmoverse in Dubai.
  - Akash is sponsoring and hosting various side events and summits at these conferences.
- Robert Del Rey and Benjamin provided updates on the Zealy program:
  - The first sprint is ending tomorrow, and they will share the final participant and reward numbers.
  - The second sprint is set to start on September 2nd.
  - They are collecting the best submissions and will share them with the community.
- Discussion around improving communication to Akash insiders about upcoming events and opportunities to support.

#### Product and Engineering Roadmap
- Scott Carruthers provided updates on the improvements to the provider build process:
  - The improvements are currently in beta testing by core community members and provider partners.
  - The team is working on documenting the changes and preparing for wider deployment.
- Zeke discussed the Snapshot Service project:
  - The project is in the final stages of stress testing before going live.
  - The goal is to provide hourly snapshots of the Akash mainnet, sandbox, and other environments to assist with testing and development.
  - The scripts will be open-sourced so that providers can set up their own snapshot services.
- Discussion around the upcoming Cosmos SDK upgrade to 0.47 and plans for community testing.
  - The team is forming a working group to coordinate testing efforts across the community.

### GitHub Discussions
#### Deep Square Proposal
- Dominikus Brian and the Deep Square team (Luca Esposito, Florin Dzeladini) presented their proposal to integrate Deep Square's HPC-as-a-service solution with the Akash network.
  - Deep Square's goal is to leverage Akash's decentralized cloud infrastructure to provide HPC resources for researchers and scientific workloads.
  - The proposal outlined a three-phase integration plan, including Deep Square becoming an Akash provider.
- Anil Murty, Artur Troian, and others provided feedback and suggestions:
  - Concerns about the technical feasibility of integrating two separate orchestration solutions (Deep Square's and Akash's).
  - Questions about the demand driver and how this would specifically benefit the Akash network.
  - Advice to first try running Deep Square as an Akash provider to better understand the integration before proposing further collaboration.
- The discussion will continue on the GitHub discussion thread, and the Deep Square team was encouraged to reach out to the Akash team for further support.

#### DeAI World Proposal
- Carlos A. Vera and the DeAI World team (including Joshua Bate) presented their proposal to use Akash for deploying large language models (LLMs) and providing ownership and rewards to users.
  - The goal is to enable communities to have ownership and control over the data and knowledge generated by interacting with LLMs.
  - The team is in a heavy R&D phase, exploring different deployment and monetization models for these LLM services.
- Anil Murty and others asked for clarification on the value proposition and how this would drive adoption of the Akash network.
  - The team explained the focus on user ownership, data privacy, and building a rewarded ecosystem around LLM interactions.
  - They emphasized that while in an R&D phase, they have made significant progress and have interest from partners and potential users.
- The team will look into providing a demo and continue the discussion on the GitHub thread.

### Other Topics
- Tyler Wright encouraged the community to get involved in the various SIGs and working groups, including the upcoming SIG Economics and Website/Documentation working group meetings.
- He mentioned that notes and recordings from the meeting will be made available Soon.

### Action Items
- Dominikus Brian and Deep Square team to continue discussion on GitHub and explore potential integration with Akash.
- DeAI World team to provide a demo and continue discussion on GitHub.
- Community members to get involved in SIGs and working groups, especially upcoming meetings for SIG Economics and Website/Documentation.
