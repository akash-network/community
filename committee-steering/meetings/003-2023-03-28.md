## Notes

- Anil kicked off by talking about the Agenda. Anil asked if anyone has anything to add to the meetng agenda.
- Anil asked if anyone has any feedback about the Akash Community Process.
- Anil would like folks to look into the remaining open pull requests. Stale pull requests should be closed.
- Cheng gave a short presentation on Stable Payments.
- Economics 2.0 is such a large topic. Breaking down.
- The next item on the agenda was the Cloudmos Funding Proposal.

### Progress of Projects:

- Anil will remove Console-GA from project list. It is done. More discussions will happen during sig-clients. 
- Cheng will talk more about progress
- GPU is still highpriority. Artur is working hard to get to a Community Testnet up and running. Internal testnet is happening right now.  
- Microservices refactor has been paused for now. This should be moved down as a priority. 
- Content Moderation should move up the priority list. Jigar and the Praetor team have worked on this. This could be in "implementation" phase.
- Client Libraries can be moved to "implementation". GO and Java client libraries
- Console AuthZ can be moved to "implementation". Denis has finalized designs, and Joseph is starting the work.
- Docs Site can be moved into "implementation". Luna and his team are working on migrating to Hugo, and following the spec outlined. This can move up the priority list because work is happening via sig-documentation. 
- Anil talked about the Omnibus repo. This needs conistent maintence for auditing and fixing SDLS. A volunteer is needed to manage the current SDLs and they should look to add new SDLs to Omnibus. Cloudmos, Console, and Terraform all use the tool. 
- Stable Payments and Settlement should be its own priority. This should be moved up. 
- Events Planning is about to go on chain for a vote via Chandra Station. There has been discussions for multiple weeks. This priority should move up and be labeled "implementation".
- Adam added Akash Hackathon (via wg-akash-hackathon) as a priority. There will be a governance proposal hitting the chain today, hopefully.
- Anil has talked about the work sig-analytics is doing. There is a spec for the data that Akash does not have. A team member from Messari may join the next sig-analytics meeting. 

### Cheng discussion on Stable Payments

- Adam, Cheng, and Anil have worked on phase 1 of a spec for Stable Payments. Will share shortly. 
- First multicurrency integration would be USDC. 
- Take rate implementation will be another part of stable payments.
- The goal is to get these features to market very quickly. 
- Please feel free to chime in via Discord. 


### Cloudmos Funding Proposal

- Boz asked some questions that he put in [Github discussions](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/85#discussioncomment-5456374). 
- Discussions were focused on business model and profitability. 
- Boz asked Max his approach to sustainability.
- Max says the business model for the feature is a SAAS model, with a free tier that is a minimal product, and the business or advanced features would be behind a paywall. 
- Max made a point that adoption needs to pick up before he believes a kick on.
- Boz asked if Max can provide more details on the hours for the work that he has outlined in the proposal. 
- Boz was asking about the risk of big asks. Boz wants a small quarter by quarter funding approach. 
- Greg asked that Cloudmos proposal be more granular. Praetor proposal is more granular. 
- Greg says there is no plan to
- Mintscan and Big Dipper already have explorers
- Greg suggests making a proposal by project. Each project should have a validation factor. 
- Greg wants to make it clear that this kind of proposal is setting the precendent. Cloudmos is a top ecosystem partner, so it is important to get this right. 
- Cheng mentioned that a good template for the kind of proposal to submit could be Events and Hackathon Proposal. It is about accountability. This should be standard for all proposals.
- Max said that this makes sense. 
- Cheng mentions that there should be a standard for all governance process. 
- Adam is working on a best practices document to share with the community for governance proposals and other discussions. 
- Max is fine to break the proposals down, but making so many proposals by project is a lengthy process. They thought it was better to have 1 larger ask that includes a number of projects.
- Adam suggested that some projects should be fast tracked by the steering committee. Adam would like to have specs for projects.
- Adam mentioned that things need to be defined more strictly, because more people are starting contribute to Akash.
- Adam stated that more contributions need to be made to the core product. JWT Authentication is an example.
- Adam thinks that Max needs to work on JWT Authentication. This is higher priority then deploy tool. 
- Adam asked what Max thought about the feedback. 
- Adam asked if the work around Analytics is apart of sig-analytics. Anil answered that Cloudmos has an indexer. Their indexer is not open source as of right now.
- Adam mentioned that work around analytics should come from sig-analtics. 
- Greg says thats projects can batched into a single proposal. Still needs to be more granular. Max felt like they did that. 
- Each project should have hours, approximate date of completion, and a budget attached. 
- Adam mentioned that the process being open included making PRDs for certain things. The process should be followed. Adam has no problem with patching PRDs.
- Max mentioned that the PRDs for provider attributes and sig-analytics will be followed. 
- Artur mentioned that there is other things that are needed for the core product, i.e. testing. This is currently done by Overclock Labs. It would be great for testing to come project.
- Artur mentioned that Osmosis way of proposals is not bad. It is quick and easy. 
- Anil mentions that Max should write the spec for Provider Attributes. Anil is doing it because no one else is doing it. Max is poised to work on this spec and make a PR. 
- Anil also asked about what is open sourced. Everything but webui is open sourced. 
- Adam is very understanding on why the proposal was made. The hesistation is that the large ask needs to be folded in the new open source framework we have. 
- ***Process is a PRD is made and then Development of PRD if funded.***
- Anil clarified that the Provider Attributes PRD is old. Max can help. 
- Anil mentioned that Luna has made PRDs that have gotten comments and additions from others.
