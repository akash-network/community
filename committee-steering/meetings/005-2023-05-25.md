## Notes

- Anil kicked off the meeting by talking about the agenda for this steering committee meeting.
- Anil mentioned that the Github discussions should be a topic for the future.
- Anil asked if there were any issues with Akash Community Groups.
- Anil walked through the project list.
- Luna gave a demo on the docs 2.0. 
- Anil mentioned that there are some discussions for a new indexer. You can find the [proposal here](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/234).
- Anil mentioned that the proposal in discussions will be open source.



### Progress of [Projects](https://github.com/akash-network/community/blob/main/projects-list/README.md)

- Anil mentioned that GPU Support is the biggest thing. GPU Testnet is the biggest project right now, being handled by many teams across the community. 
- Anil mentioned that Artur is working on support GPU attributes. This will allow a user to deploy on specific types of GPUs from a provider.
- Anil mentioned there is work happenning in the clients to help with changes.
- Anil mentioned that there is a plan for a comprehensive GPU Testnet. There is a document with a [GPU Testnet plan](https://github.com/akash-network/community/pull/229).
- There are two phases. First phase is to build supply and build SDLs.
- Phase two will focus on testing SDLs and benchmark GPUs.
- There are various tasks for each phase. 
- Anil asked if there are any questions related to GPU Testnet?
- Greg talked about the two personas for GPU testnet. 
- Providers and AI developers are the two personas. 
- The testnet will help understand some of the problems and how to solve the problems with AI workloads.
- The goal is to stress test the code and the network.
- Andrew G asked if the GPU Testnet is successful, when would the mainnet upgrade happen?
- Anil answered that the mainnet upgrade should happen in the next 45-60 days, unless there are major issues.
- Andrew Mello asked if the new GPU testnet will support provider attributes. Anil reiterated
- Praetor team is going to support setting up a GPU provider. They gave a demo yesterday at sig-providers.
- Praetor deployed the code to prod today for setting up a GPU Provider in the Testnet.
- Andrew Mello talked about some content moderation tooling that he is working on. Andrew is trying to get this online over the next couple of days.
- Adam Bozanich has been working on Take rate. Initial tests have passed. 
- Take rate will be apart of the GPU Testnet; in the background.
- Economics 2.0 should be moved into Implentation.
- Cheng asked if there should be incentives for testing take rates in the GPU Testnet. 
- Anil mentioned that if we want to add testing in for take rate it will delay the testnet start. There needs to be work on the clients side.
- Andrew G. asked if take rate should be apart of this testnet. 
- Adam made it clear that this should be a beta release. The chain element works, but other parts of the experience need to be more useable. 
- Artur mentioned that take rate will be supported in the chain, but it will be off. There need to be multiple testnets to try with different bridges. 
- Adam Wozney talked about upcoming events. Community reps will be at the events in Europe. 
- Q3 budget proposal for wg-events-2023 is being approved before going on chain as community pool spend. Messari mainnet is a big event in Q3.
- Adam Wozney also talked about Akash Hackathon. This is a community owned hackathon. Registration kicks off June 26th over 2 weeks. 
- The hackathon will run for 1 month. 
- Greg asked if the hackathon will be virtual or in person? Adam Wozney clarified that the hackathon will be digital. 
- Anil gave an update about provider attributes. There is an internal spec being reviewed. If anyone wants access message Anil and he can get early access.
