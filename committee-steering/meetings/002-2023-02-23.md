- There have been a couple of rounds of reviews of specs 
- Greg talked about progress being made on sig-economics. Members are putting models together for security.
- In the sig-providers meeting, there were some actions items around provider attribute spec. The group also talked about benchmarking for providers. Classes of provider are not clear, and adding more attributes may not be best for choosing a provider. 
- Anil asked how does the steering committee wants to tackle the work around provider benchmarking. 
- Greg said that if the work takes multiple people over a couple of weeks, than it should be a working group. If the task is very quick, 
- Adam recommended a working group to finalize a spec for benchmarking api. 


### Project List

- Anil updated the Project List after last meeting.
- The group went through the list of projects to update state.

- Artur mentioned the work sig-chain is doing for the network upgrade. New parameters need to be introoduced for (https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/16) and [issue #18](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/18)
- We can not doing [Issue #20](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/20) this network upgrade anymore. We have to fork, first then update this next network upgrade.
- Artur mentioned that Akash API is apart of the microservices switch. Instead of using multiple reposisitories, the API will handle things very efficiently. Providers Services API will be defined in this repo. 
- Work can be found at [Akash API](https://github.com/akash-network/akash-api)
- Client Libraries spec is ready. 
- Going to hold off on working on Authorize Spend spec right now.

### Praetor Presentation

- There are a number of key friction points for users trying to be providers on the Akash Network. Issues include no content modertation , no dashboards, no financial management, and other items.
- Praetor wants to bring Helm into their infrastructure. The upgrade path should be the same for all providers. Existing providers will be migrated to helm. New providers would be made using Helm charts. 
- Praetor also mentioned some miscellaneous features
- Asking for 50,000 akt in two trenches to be done over the next 5 months.
- Anil asked if the provider anaylytics api will be improved, and it will be open so everyone can use. 
- Praetor team will contribute work directly to the provider as well as with Praetor App.
- Anil asked if the Praetor team is still focusing energy on deploy tool. Jigar mentioned that 

### Discussion of Cloudmos Proposal

Discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/akash-network/community/discussions/85)
- There are milestones, but there are not specifics on what the deliverables are.
- There is a lot of duplicative work that Cloudmos is asking for funds for, that a sig or working group is already handling. 
- It would be better to break up the proposal into smaller parts with specific deliverables and how they will be tested.
- It would be great to add projects in Github, and then ask for specific funding for those items. 
- Max heard the feedback from the community, and understands that things look very broad. The hope was to have smaller portions of money over time. 
- Provider profile was provider attributes with a picture and other information about the provider. 
- Max will take the feedback and make smaller proposals to share with the community. 
- If there is a database, who manages the database? Is it public data?
- Greg mentioned that the community pool is not large. This is why the economics 2.0 is important, in order to add developer pools.
- If Max wants to create a proposal to open source the indexer, for the work they have done, and future work, then that would be a great next step. 
- Max and his team will think about it.
- **Max asked if there was a timeline for implementation of new Akash Economics 2.0.** Developers are needed, and Greg mentioned hoping to have a spec in March 2023. 
- Implementation could be two months after the spec is developed, and there will be akt behind it. GO Developer 

### Action Items

- Anil to create an issue to decide what needs to happen with provider benchmarking. Group can determine whether or not a working group needs to be formed. 
- Anil to create a working group for Economics 2.0
- Adam or Anil to move over spec for microservices into the public repository.
- Anil will merge PR from Luna after reviews from participants through 2023-03-04
