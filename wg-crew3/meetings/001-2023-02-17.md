## Notes
* Adam Wozney opened the meeting, thanking everyone for joining the Working Group-Crew3 call.  
* Adam Wozney highlighted that this is the first community-focused working group that has been formed. 
* Adam mentioned that he did not know much about Crew3 before it was brought to his attention. He proposed demoing Crew3 and walking through some of its tools, features, and aspects that make it interesting for potentially launching a community presence.
* Adam mentioned that after the demo, the group plans to discuss managing the community presence on Crew3, creating a reward structure for community involvement, and identifying additional topics to cover.
*  Adam emphasized the importance of avoiding an inactive presence, as it would reflect poorly on the group.


### Demo of Crew3
* Adam Wozney asks if there is anything else to cover about Crew3 before a demo.
* Robert shares his screen and explains that Crew3 is a tool that lets you engage with your community in a different way.
* He explains that community members can do missions to earn points and engage with projects.
* He shows a demo of a mission to follow a Twitter page and earn points.
* Robert talks about how people can earn points for two weeks and then select a winner before starting over with a new set of missions.
* He also mentions his contacts with the guy managing the Crew3 on Crescent who can help with Akash Crew3.
* He shows a staking mission with daily connect and Twitter follow.
* Robert explains the difference between missions that are locked and unlocked and how they can be customized based on conditions such as Discord roles and completing certain quests
* Robert mentions that some missions are automatically validated while others need to be reviewed manually
* Robert discusses how other networks such as Crescent use quests and suggests ways that Akash can customize quests for their own network, such as writing a tweet about Akash or hosting a Celestia node
* Robert mentions that rewards for completing quests are points and rewards and that there are templates available if unsure what quests to create
* Robert suggests that the Quests tool is worth exploring and adapting for use with Akash

### After Crew3's Demo Discussion
Adam asks about the number of people on the platform and the most successful community on Crew3.
Andrew mentions Mantra Network as having a big community with 160 submissions a day.
Andrew explains that rewards are given through a leaderboard and suggests talking to Mantra Network's community admins for more information.

####  **potential rewards for the Akash Crew3 program**
Andrew suggested that rewards can include T-shirts, AKT tokens, or other items, depending on the project's choice.
Gino Bernardi introduces a project called Dibs Domains that allows communities to own their own domains using a decentralized DNS system. Gino proposes that the decentralized domains can be offered as prizes on Crew3.
Andrew Gnatyuk thinks what Gino is proposing is a great idea and suggests other prizes such as cloud services or discounts.
Gino offers to follow up with Andrew to discuss a potential partnership.
Adam Wozney raises concerns about active management of the platform and fair reward structure for Crew3.

#### Incentive Packages for Crew3 Management
* Adam Wozney initiated the discussion on community governance and asked for opinions on how to incentivize people to manage Crew3, and how many people would be required for the job. 
* Robert suggested that 2-3 people would be enough to set up the community and ensure active participation. He also recommended offering monetary incentives as the best way to incentivize people.
* Andrew shared a rough estimate of the cost, which he had shared on the group's shared document. He suggested a payment of $500 USD in Akt per month for two people to work on tasks and moderate. He also recommended additional rewards for the contributors and marketing.
* Adam appreciated the shared [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rG9-pxlV0K0gCQYTroePCwj_zT2STPsMO_XGKGIdJEU/edit) and suggested that the Steering Committee should approve it before putting it up for community governance vote on funding. He requested everyone to provide their feedback and suggested breaking down the funding and making it public for comments.
* Andrew suggested that he would talk to fellow projects with a crew suite to make rough assumptions on the finance required for managing Crew3. Adam agreed, and also suggested granting access to individuals who want to participate in managing Crew3.



#### Security and Access Management on Crew3
* Adam Wozney suggests the need to ensure that people are doing what they said they would do, and asks how to take people out of managing the project if they're not fulfilling their responsibilities.
* Adam suggests using One Password to manage access to the project, with a central area for managing the system and overseeing the admins.
* Robert suggests that One Password allows for five free admins, and explains how to remove an admin if necessary.
* Adam suggests the need for a Master Admin, who has ultimate authority over the project, and for a clear understanding of the budget and incentives for managing and contributing to the project.

 ### budgeting and campaign planning
* Adam suggests the need for a yearly budget template to track expenses and contributions to the project, with community involvement in the process.
* Adam Wozney talks about payouts and prizes being important and needing to share them with the steering community and put them up for governance vote to get funding.
Andrew Gnatyuk suggests creating budgets for campaigns instead of the whole year and asks for funding for the three-month campaign on the crews.
* Adam asks about the cost of Crew3 and whether it is easy to delete the platform if the community does not support it.
* Andrew confirms that Crew3 is free and deleting the platform is not a problem.
* Adam suggests including the ability to delete the platform in the proposal doc and proposing a three-month pilot for the project.
* Andrew proposes four stages for the campaign, including learning how to deploy on Akash, getting started with Akash, subscribing to projects and additional that we can be repeatable tasks
Adam asks for thoughts from others on the proposed approach.

### Final thoughts 
* Robert asked Damir Simpovic about his thoughts on the platform after the demo.
* Damir Simpovic liked the platform but thinks it needs dedication from someone to create a positive buzz and get people interested.
* Adam Wozney agrees with Damir and encourages people to contribute their thoughts on the document shared in the Crew3 working group discord channel.
* Adam Wozney suggests that people who are interested in managing Crew3 add their names and discord handles to the document under proposed manager. Adam highlighted that once the document is finalized, they can pitch it for funding and put it up for a community governance proposal.
