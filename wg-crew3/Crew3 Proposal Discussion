The platform: Crew3 https://crew3.xyz/ lets you manage and grow your communities using engaging missions or quests which earn you points for the leaderboard. 
The plan is to use the data to find committed and talented community members while opening new ways for existing members to interact and get more involved with the Akash community.

Desired outcomes 
Context, Networks like Umee, Crescent, Kyve have communities with over 8k, 2k and 14k Members respectively. Although other networks don't enjoy that many members, we do think Akash could attract at least 500 curious devs and tech enthusiasts to test out Akash. 
By the end of the 2 months campaign, Akash should be able to recruit/retain 25 Talented Devs who continue developing/hosting apps on Akash.
Although the main focus would be in people outside the Akash ecosystem, we want to extend the invitation to existing community members. 
- How many new community members we expect to attract 
We should be aware that many bots will be attracted to this platform, thats why most of the missions will be reviewed and approved/rejected manually. We think a 15% of real humans to complete missions is a reasonable number
- How many new deployments? 
Between 500 and 1,000 deployments since the majority of the missions will be focused on Deploying different tools, dapps, nodes on Akash 
- How many new EDU students
At least 250 new EDU students since 1 of the missions in the Stage #1 is completing the Intro to Praetor Course
- How many new Insiders?

Who will manage the Akash Crew3 platform? 

Up to 5 members can be assigned the admin role and have full control of the Crew3 platform, also there are others roles with limited functions like “reviewer” “editor” or just “guest”. Nominated community members can take on these roles if needed. 

At this stage, we consider that 2 community members could receive, review and respond to the flow of submissions while keeping Akash Crew3 fresh with new missions and ways for providers, tenants and other community members to get started in Akash. These members can be appointed or removed via community vote.
