Robert Del Rey: Alright, alright. Alright. Hello guys, Happy Monday. Welcome to this. silly working group call Last week we had our first pilot test I guess this is the second call we do and today is gonna be really fun. Because last week we kind of presented the general idea quick overview of the idea some folks of the idea. And also what could be a possible budget for this initial pilot. So this past week I was working with Benji.

Robert Del Rey: Coming up with New Missions getting the right balance between a good Mission. And what would be a good price for the mission when people do them? We also work in some strategies to share those and those are The main topic I want to discuss with you guys. So without further Ado, I will go ahead and get right into it. And yeah.

Robert Del Rey: I'm sharing attached this not This is the silly dashboard here you will be able to see the missions We Gather so far at the moment we have. 12 complete missions plus two more missions ideas making it 14 missions total. and the prices initially there they were

Robert Del Rey: 25 50 akt 100 AKP and after a few feedbacks we reduce the price. That way we can make more use of our budget and more people have a chance to get something out of the missions. So right now the average permission is between five and 10 akd, which I believe is still very fair since ikashi's over a dollar or ready and five bucks. It's a monthly subscription in anything. So, I believe it's a fair price. Thank you rotary for your ideas. You really helped me a lot in trying to get the best number. Another thing we were working on last week was let me open up my notion now.

Robert Del Rey: I wasn't ready for this call guys. I mean I was reading something I was planning to get a shower and when I saw I just got the notification like hey your city call is just a status. So please bear with me. I wasn't 100% ready for this call.

Scott Hewitson: You do it you're doing great. You doing great. Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks Scott you you're the man? so yeah guys, this is the dashboard. Let me share the screen better. Right. I have Microsoft Edge the entire screen. Let's go with entire screen. I'm sharing now and you should be able to see the notion page I have for the silly pilot. So what I wanted to talk about in this call, yeah is this I wanted to present this to Tyler and the guys and shared the actual pot the action plan. I want to polish out the silly document a little more.

Robert Del Rey: So that I can upload it to GitHub. and the reason I want to upload it to git Hobbies because we are doing 95% of a cash discussions on GitHub. So I believe it's a good idea if we just go ahead and upload this to GitHub right away after a few weeks and start getting Community feedback now. And yeah, that's my mission. If it's for me, we can launch this today. I don't mind. I believe we have enough material to launch today. Okay. Do you see the city dashboard now

Tyler Wright: No, we're just still see your notion screen.

Robert Del Rey: You still see the ocean? Okay, let me fix that. I swear I click on entire as screen. I see I have Some screens now. I got it. That was the shortcut. Okay, okay.

Robert Del Rey: Let's do this. guys, we're live. Okay, we're with me.

00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: I have

Robert Del Rey: okay, I will try Let me know if you see the Sealy. dashboard now

Scott Hewitson: I see it.

Tyler Wright: Yes.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you guys. this is one of my favorite missions. This one doesn't get you any akt. But we'll get you some experience points can be used for something later down the line. I guess. It's really simple just go to osmosis swap some token for akd and you the transaction hash link, you're upload it here and that gives you a hundred XP. I guess it's a good mission to get started because with C, for example, you cannot search for this and join right away.

Robert Del Rey: The only way to join it's doing a mission. So I believe this is a good mission to just join the city dashboard. You can start with any mission right? But I believe if you do this one first, it's gonna be easy simple and people will do it quickly and they will get access without much hassle in my honest opinion. So guys what I was saying before sharing you this screen is that I'm planning to start this today running for And after two weeks, I will share some stats with you.

Robert Del Rey: I asked for some kpis ideas and feedbacks for some kpis. We're still working on that but I believe we should use time and start this now because people are going into holiday season some of them try to relax some of them just disappear from the market altogether. So I guess we have to take advantage of these two weeks before we go full into Christmas mode in my opinion. So I will go ahead and start sharing this missions on Twitter on telegram on a cache Discord. And the main focus for me is attracting people that are part of the community. And the reason why studies because I want them to become more active. I want to keep this in house initially.

Robert Del Rey: And then once we got a few people doing the missions and rewarding akt, we can go ahead and expand this to a cash social media and share that on social media and potentially reaching more people. Yeah, after those two weeks. We're gonna review the missions when I say, I'm referring to Benji and I we're gonna review the missions and One week after we are done. We're gonna paid out those rewards so we can have enough time to review the missions to make sure they are quality missions and to make sure we have the funding to start giving away the rewards instead of giving them

Robert Del Rey: Right away. offer between how we review the missions and then paint out the reward. It's gonna be fine. And yeah, I know I said a lot in five minutes, but that's my general idea of silly how we can get started how we can follow up and now it's the time for your input guys. I love to know what you think about now after a complete week pass now, you can see there is more order in the city dashboard. We have some missions the categories change. We had one stage to a stage stage 3 the category change for onboarding deploy on a cash in you and a cash account.

Robert Del Rey: And depending on the category that missions are going to be different in the deployed my cash. I have more missions because I guess those were easier to think about and come up with. But Akashi to you, if you notice this one doesn't pay any AKP, but if you some XP points, so just still gonna get something out of it if you do it. I guess also we can complement other initiatives using silly. For example, if there are bounties we can create a bounty category and just respond is there so when people access they will know exactly where to go to find the bounties or to find the missions that they're gonna

00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, I'm done. it's your turn to do the talking. I see some hands race which I love thank you. I don't know who raised the hands first. So guys be gentlemen's whoever raised the hands. First go first,…

Tyler Wright: Go ahead Ben.

Robert Del Rey: please. All right.

Benjamin B: All right, that makes me I wanted to say that for the first task for the initial one to get the rest of the dashboard. If we do what you plan for that to have the house from swapping will be osmosis. We are only targeting people who over they have. Cosmos based coins is this intentional or not?

Robert Del Rey: That's a good point Maybe wasn't intentional. But now that you mention it you're right, maybe this. Can only be inviting to people in the cosmos ecosystem and could push away people outside. The customer's ecosystem. However, I guess she's a cosmos based project even though we try to extend out on our own Akashi Cecilia Customs project. So I don't believe it's gonna be an issue at least in this first stage. That's what I think although it's a great observation I didn't notice until you mention it.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I think we could solve this if you wanted to because there is a testament force it and I believe that you get from using that test net force it so by just changing the text and the leading them to that force it you could just have the same Mission but for testnet users so If you want that's to happen. They will just open the faucet. They'll write their akt address. And they will get the testnet funds there and they will get onboarded to the dashboard.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, I like that Let's do it. Whatever makes these more accessible to people I'm all ears. So thank you for that in poop. And you?

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: excellent Yeah,…

Robert Del Rey: Alright Tyler they get away.

Tyler Wright: I really like what you put together here. Obviously, we can adjust some of the specific missions to I like what you just said actually just a minute or so ago about aligning with whether it be Akash goals or other cigs and working groups initiatives, whether it be hackathon events, whatever, the edu program we can add this kind of programming. So I really like that. I do want to change some of these specific missions and from an overarching standpoint. I am curious right because right now it seems like The pilot and Huey, correct me if I'm wrong, but at least the pilot and phase one has been approved via the bounties.

Tyler Wright: I'm not really sure we need to necessarily go to discussions with anything at this point. I think that we can have the pilot start to get some users interacting with dealing and figure out from there. If you want to have a wire discussion to get more funds to face to but I think the focus should just be getting users. And frankly, I'm not saying that we shouldn't have insiders and vanguards and folks like that interact with this. as quickly as possible, but I feel like the focus of zealy should be about onboarding new people, like wow.

Tyler Wright: It's great Robert for you to do a mission. There's other ways that I can get you you join all the Insiders meetings. You're already engaged. I think at least to me the point of zealy was to get more folks like you that are not involved yet and maybe need that push and zealy could be a push of I can do something and learn about a project. I think it's interesting and want to be involved with but I can also earn some akt or some experience points or it could be game of fine in the way. So I would like for us and this is just my opinion for even out of the gates, maybe social media is good. But I would like for us to try to insert ourselves and to other communities and said, join our zealy, or put this in the general chat and say hey, if you're looking for a way to get involved, here's another way to get involved be a zealy and look for people that are either on the fringes of the community or outside of the community versus people like yourself or Benjamin.

00:15:00

Tyler Wright: George that are really accountable reliable and already very engaged And I'm not saying you all can't do the activities, but I think we want to find more people like you as opposed to just continue to give you akt, which we could do. In other ways. I think

Robert Del Rey: Absolutely meant agree 100% Thank you for that. I mean, right. I read a few.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I really like the idea.

Robert Del Rey: things down your hand up.

Tyler Wright: I really like the idea of a test net provider. I don't know what installed Cloud most is because I feel like most people are now using the web app. So is that just connecting? Maybe it should be connect your wallet to Cloud most or something like that either Kepler or leap, and they can do that, Because yeah, I don't think many people are using.

Tyler Wright: The downloaded version anymore. I think that people just use a web app.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, I wasn't aware of that that tells you how long I go was the last time I used cloudbus.

Tyler Wright: Yeah. Yeah, I think you have to attach your wallet to be able to effectively do anything in Cloud Wells…

Robert Del Rey: Thank you for that.

Tyler Wright: which I don't really love but Yeah, that could be an experience or an activity in itself is like they're connecting their wallet.

Tyler Wright: And then you can access the cost of living.

Tyler Wright: Go ahead Ben.

Benjamin B: I would like some missions also related to creating something of their own here everything you can do by just the following steps kind of but there's nothing and that's Target's creating something unique. We have the deployed WordPress website, but it should be something specific but just rather it should just be the template. I would like these missions to be greater. So your own app and deploy it to my gosh maybe even if it's super simple.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I would agree with that. I create your own sdl create dockerized something that you have or contribute to awesome Akash, if there's something that you don't want to do it's not your own website create something that can be added to awesome I think these are great examples Benjamin. I agree with you, wholeheartedly of things that should be specific missions, I would actually vote and this is just again my opinion up for discussion vote against having people doing generic things maybe

Tyler Wright: one of the simple games from awesome Akash can be at a starter mission for folks so that people can interact with learning how to deploy and see a deployment up and running very quickly, but I don't know if we want people just like trying to earn five akt and doing something for 10 seconds, I think we want people contributing to the ecosystem really like doing things to other people can benefit from

Robert Del Rey: thanks, the

Robert Del Rey: And I agree 100% with you guys and that's why I believe it's so critical to find that balance. I also don't want people to do just deploy whatever. Shed, they think about and let me claim my stuff, right? So yeah, we gotta be super specific in what we're looking for. But we're gonna find a way to let people be themselves and build whatever stuff they want to build because they keep for me. The key thing is that Having them using a cache. That's what I want to do initially or at least that is one of my main goals make them use a cash doesn't matter what they do. But make them use a cash and I love your ideas guys, create your own Docker. Is that okay? If I say that and contribute to us some awesome my cash. I believe are great ideas for other missions.

Robert Del Rey: The keyword, it's like own your own and stuff I guess that gives people the space they need to create whatever they want to build and still build something useful.

Robert Del Rey: The other comments or feedbacks guys.

Scott Hewitson: I'll just stay. I mean it looks great, turning it around in a week. This is Exactly the kind of stuff, we want to use. In my mind, if we can do a little pilot programs like this, it's quickly learn quickly adjust quickly, Redeploy, whatever we're doing. No, I like it a lot. I think we just, keep moving fast and I'm excited to see what kind of traffic we can get.

00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: Yeah.

Scott Hewitson: I need to Pivot we can pivot so I'm happy about it.

Robert Del Rey: It's interesting man for I'm also very much looking forward to it. Hey My brother, I know you are super busy. Sometimes George's super both in a cash groups making notes. He also has his own communities. So my bad George because I believe I assigned this to you without properly asking you how you could contribute to this project. So I'm using this platform now to ask you in front of everybody. What do you think you can do and how you want to help because I know you want to help right, but maybe you were too busy this last week to contribute with some messages. So if you could maybe let me know how you think you can help us and we can go from there That is very straight about working in a community.

Robert Del Rey: You're muted your channel hear you if you're talking.

Scott Hewitson: He may not be able to chat right now. but

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, it's fine. It happens. I will send him a message.

Scott Hewitson: good, I was gonna say since we're trying to move fast to after this, we can start. Getting y'all funds. So whether Robert if you want to hold it or Benji George, just let me know and we'll get that. Paid out and we can just start tracking from there. We've got quite a big dip right now on akt, so I want to do it now.

Robert Del Rey: Alright, I will go ahead and create the wallet after this call and send it to you because I honestly didn't do…

Scott Hewitson: Okay, perfect.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks for the reminder.

Scott Hewitson: No worries.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, yeah. That lots of notes. Thank you so much guys, this call was great. What do you think about the time? Was it good for you? This time today this day. To have in this call.

Scott Hewitson: Yes, that's fine for me.

Benjamin B: yeah, it worked for me as

Robert Del Rey: For me, it's also fine.

Robert Del Rey: Awesome, that's good to hear George thumbs up seems that this time is also good for him. Thanks Tyler for arranging this again. And yeah. reviews one Okay, someone did a mission already.

Scott Hewitson: I love it.

Robert Del Rey: I have she 21

Scott Hewitson: I love it. It's not even on blast yet and people are already doing stuff.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, yes,…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: so let's go ahead and use this so you can see how the missions look like when you're reviewing them. For example, you see pending and history here. You can see all the missions that the community has done in the past. Really nice. Remember I've been doing this since August. So it's understandable. You're gonna see very old missions here. This one was claimed three months ago. Really good. Now the one that are pending for review are gonna appear here as you can see it's suspending. You click on the mission. This is the mission description. This is the same that the person so when they initially saw the mission. And this is the submission depending on.

Robert Del Rey: On the depending on the submission type type People can submit links images they can do certain actions. and this person uploaded a link. I'm a scare now to click on this because it doesn't look familiar to me at all. But yeah, I'm gonna take this one for you guys. Let's see where this takes. Okay. What is this guys? Do you know?

Benjamin B: Yeah, it's someone that installed the CL.

Robert Del Rey: awesome Really cool. It seems this is a screenshot that was uploaded as a link I believe. or not am I tripping?

00:25:00

Tyler Wright: Yes, I think it is a screenshot that was updated as a link in the shortened.

Scott Hewitson: You're right.

Tyler Wright: I would love and I have to play around with zealy this week. I think as here. We just have one. I think those are next steps is creating a wallet us transferring the funds over to you ASAP while there's a dip and before December starts and then doing some testing and you sharing some messaging in different channels. It looks like zealy has their own Community, which we should also try to leverage as well. So those are action items.

Robert Del Rey: yes.

Tyler Wright: I would love to make sure that and I don't know if this is the combined effort with George and you or the three of you but I would love to make sure that there's documentation. I think for some of these it's already linked but make sure that there's documentation links for everything and then

Tyler Wright: it just optimize the review process so that you're not opening Scary links, make sure that the formatting exactly what you want hey put the screenshot on this kind of format or whatever. Try to create as much operational structure as possible. So that it leaves zero little room for people to. Abuse, I would add all the classes from the edu to that edu section.

Robert Del Rey: he

Tyler Wright: Three persistence storage. I probably cut that one for the time being.

Robert Del Rey: Sure, I can do that, right?

Tyler Wright: Here, let's cut that one, too.

Robert Del Rey: No worries.

Robert Del Rey: Those were the only two missions that were not completed after that. All these ones have descriptions the prices and stuff. I will take your advice Tyler and make sure the instructions are clear. We have the correct links. And also we have an specific format for submissions. So we know…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: what to expect when people submit stuff.

Tyler Wright: exactly …

Robert Del Rey: Thank you so much.

Tyler Wright: please my pleasure. Maybe you should have as again the stuff I just talked about created an sdl and awesome Akash or something some of those things. We just talked about I think that you'll add those later. Huey anybody else here on the calls or anything else? I'm trying to think of something like AI ml specific should build an sdl like an AI. Fbl,

Scott Hewitson: He has a text to image model on the deploy section.

Tyler Wright: Okay, cool.

Scott Hewitson: Yeah. Yeah, I mean we're just want people to get familiar get comfortable be like, this actually is kind of cool and get a little paid to do it and…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Scott Hewitson: then that can be The gateway drug to the rest of a cash.

Tyler Wright: Love that.

Robert Del Rey: the bigger Community absolutely meant great point What about a stable the future guys?

Scott Hewitson: exactly

Robert Del Rey: I saw a tweet yesterday from my cash and establish the future images. Do we have one of those meetings too?

Scott Hewitson: as a stable video or stable video diffusion. that's like I want to say ZJ made a I personally

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking about him when saying this.

Tyler Wright: There's sdxl.acost.network, we can have that as a simple mission of make an image on there and it could be for experience points, which uses your cost Network.

Robert Del Rey: let me look it up.

Benjamin B: And we could make up they must do certain things to get their XP to maybe 500 before getting any rewards.

Scott Hewitson: Actually like that one.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, for sure for sure.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, that's gonna be easy. and I like that minimum XP to earn the right to get akt, right, so

Tyler Wright: exactly

Robert Del Rey: Thank you for your input guys. Do access to AKA rewards? Yeah, That makes sense. And I was here in Tweeteria the stable video diffusion exactly. Yeah, you were right Scott. Thank you so much. I don't know how this works or…

Scott Hewitson: Got you.

Robert Del Rey: what they do it, but maybe we can add one stable diffusion mission to the ceiling. I don't mind maybe see he's gonna like that one.

00:30:00

Scott Hewitson: I mean, I think where it's at today is a great starting point. I mean, we've got quite a few missions to get a little bit of akt and get started and I think maybe the only thing that we should say is there may be a cap for rewards right now or something just in the best case where we get a ton of people and then it's like okay then that gives us good ammo to go forward and ask for more money.

Tyler Wright: I think that's a great call out.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, that's true. Because even if it's the mission is just five akd imagine 1000 people do it. so yeah,…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Scott Hewitson: Because those are good problems.

Robert Del Rey: I feel.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, Absolutely. But Yahoo, is saying thank you so much for coming that out.

Benjamin B: I'm gonna create some of these and I can claim all rewards myself.

Scott Hewitson: Okay. gamify the game

Robert Del Rey: But that sounds like something I know you would do Benji.

Benjamin B: I mean, let's be honest accept that for the authentication to zealy. We have no spam protection.

Robert Del Rey: Yes through.

Scott Hewitson: Correct.

Robert Del Rey: I remember on you me I talked with Brandon. He's the community guy over there. I'm talking almost a year back when they launched this and I remember I asked him dude. What was something you wasn't expecting from lunch in this campaign and he told me that he wasn't ready for the amount of span mission that they got over there. so yeah, that's quickest story over there. You can see some of the missions they have it's read about me check out universidi. but if you notice they only Require XP points. They don't give you you meet tokens. And the reason why studies because they do or I don't know if they still do it.

Robert Del Rey: But they do a Sprints. Let's say for this week. The one that does more XP points is gonna get extra water and people would compete to do as many missions as they can to get the required. Some of but they didn't pay you in Yumi talk and it was just experience. So people could compete in the leaderboard. so Just during that with you guys. But yeah, they got lots of spam in a staking we didn't got many spam. This was one that I spin up myself when I was with a staking.

Robert Del Rey: And we didn't get many spam because we didn't get many people in the community that discourse was 500 people in a staking the score and you can see how many people actually interacted with it like 23 people. so yeah, I guess the amount of spam it's gonna depend on the amount of people in our community. And also what missions are we gonna share with the world because missions like retweeting in tweets and sharing and stuff they get lots of a Spam and Bots account, So yeah, you're sharing that bit of experience with These are communities that have a half joined myself and do some missions, but honestly, this is the silly Academy. I was there on April March last year

Robert Del Rey: and it's real nice. I learned a lot from it and to join this one. You have to be part of the silly Discord and I was there they do a weekly call with the community managers are the people that have seen the communities that they run.

Robert Del Rey: And they share great insights over there too. It's been a few months since I don't joined the cdb score, but I will definitely be joining back to share that we have a community because if I recall correctly, of course, I'm recalling correctly. They had this channel that you could promote your project and the community managers would support each other in sharing and doing some missions and just doing missions to give you the feedback. It was a really good Community. I should go ahead and join back in now that we're talking about that. So yeah.

Robert Del Rey: Anything else guys, you want to cover this? Cause just a little recap we went over the missions the structure. You also provide me with some valuable feedback as far as missions required regard cap minimum experience in order to get the required and some missions ideas that we got ahead and translate them into silly after we're done with this call. Another thing. We spoke about was funding the wallet for this pilot and that we will take the discussions once we run this by a lot and we have more information to discuss about and guys anything else you want to go over before? I don't know we wrap this up. I guess 45 minutes is a good time for this call.

00:35:00

Robert Del Rey: You tell me but we can save one hour slot like we're doing it Tyler. But if…

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Robert Del Rey: if we make it to 45 minutes, it's gonna be more than enough if nobody else has anything to support or to share.

Tyler Wright: Sounds good to me. So we'll schedule another one for next Monday as well. And then we'll just continue to push forward. hopefully we can get that wallet funded today and then we can just continue to such a share some of these things. My only call out real quick is if we notice that we're getting a lot of spam and zealy, I would ask that we either connect as quickly as possible and just figure out a plan of action so that people aren't getting to the point where they're just asking for akt, we can limit that because it seems like the other project you were talking about me that had spam didn't give akt so I didn't really affect them. And you said some other products didn't have spam. I just want to make sure people start spamming looking for akt because the price is so good right now. We have a plan B to mitigate abuse.

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Tyler Wright: those are something for us to think about and just like having the back of our mind whether it be to increase the amount of experience points or to do something we can figure out something in the short term, but I just want to make sure that we're just kind of on high alert and if you need Huey for that to support in any way just let us know but I just want us to have that in the back of our mind.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, Ben. Let me tell you your support has been Paramount. I learned that word the other day. It has been Paramount and thank you again for pushing these guys. Yeah, please.

Tyler Wright: Please actually, thank you.

Robert Del Rey: A schedule a call for next week. So we can follow up and check how this is doing. And let me know what you think about this maybe after next week. We can go ahead and have a bye weekly call or maybe a studying next year. We can do it on a weekly basis. I guess it's gonna depend but that's an idea. I'm having right now. And also most of the community groups working group calls are five weekly. It's only a few of them that are weekly basis, right?

Tyler Wright: Yeah, it's only one. This is the second most of them are monthly so we can change the Cadence to monthly most of their monthly thick support is biweekly and then only working group Akash website is weekly so we can do it. However, you want to do it you're in charge, but let's just get through next week and we'll figure out from there.

Robert Del Rey: Let's get to next week. Are you say and I'm gonna think about that. Thank you so much guys and…

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Robert Del Rey: I hope you enjoyed the weather over there, man.
