- Benjamin agreed with Scott's perspective, stating that it makes sense to consider compensating the team for extended efforts, especially if there's a decision to push for a pilot version extension.
- Benjamin suggested reviewing all missions after the meeting, requesting an updated CSV file from Robert.

### Considerations for a Pilot Extension:
- Benjamin expressed reservations about doubling everything without further analysis, suggesting that with a new pilot, they could apply new knowledge and potentially make adjustments based on their recent experience.
- Scott Hewitson proposed a hybrid approach, suggesting that after the meeting, if they decide to extend, they can announce it and run the script to pay out participants who completed existing missions around the 15th.

Robert Del Rey: All right everybody. And happy Monday. We are here in the fourth silly working group call. Really nice. It's great that we have this column Monday. It's the beginning of the week. We kind of feel like motivated. We rest on the weekend and during this call we can focus on what we did last week. And what is the plan for this week and going forward? It's crazy. How the time flies We had the pilot call where we set everything up and now this pilot is gonna end this Friday the 15th.

Robert Del Rey: So four five days until the Pilot ends at least the missions and submissions period after that week Benjamin, I will go ahead and review the missions and calculate the akt prices that are gonna be given out paid out. So really excited times. We also learned a lot. So in my agenda, I got a few things but I gotta ask guys. Do you have any special topics you want to discuss so I can add it to the agenda?

Scott Hewitson: The only thing I was gonna ask about is any metrics we have but I know you're on top of stuff. So you're probably already in your agenda.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, I do have a list of the metrics we want to consider. So yeah. Hey better you go.

Tyler Wright: Hey one item. I was thinking about over the weekend is based upon how much participation we've had in this initial pilot. I was wondering and this is this question for Huey, too.

Robert Del Rey: I just added to the agenda. Thank you so much. So let's just start with the beginning the silly Quest board Mission updates.

Robert Del Rey: As you may know the first mission was like a gatekeeper. If you didn't do that mission first, you couldn't access the other missions in a cash, silly. but something happened Benji brought to my attention that If there was a way that this Mission could verify themselves so people can just click get access and then they can do the other missions. And the point was that. we didn't want to make people wait until they could start doing missions. So the first mission was set up in a way that Benji had to review the missions. So that could be 10 hours 12 hours apart 24 hours apart. So when we accepted the missions, we noticed that

Robert Del Rey: those members didn't do any more missions, so that is possibly because They just forgot about it and drop this so we made a change in the first mission to get access to the cash silly is out of claimable. Meaning that when I go ahead and get that tested talking. I just gotta visit the page. And the mission is gonna be claimed right away for you. So that's gonna happen automatically Benji doesn't have to review this now and that way if someone step across a cash, silly. They can try it out faster than it was before because now it's gonna be okay. Let me do the first mission. It was review right away, and I can have access now to the other missions.

Robert Del Rey: And before it was let me do this Mission and now I have to wait until this guy review the missions so I can start doing the other missions. So I don't know if I'm making sense to you guys. But this was a small thing that added to the experience because now like I said, Benji was right be a few people got in now and I started doing the missions right away instead of waiting to start doing the missions. So that is a big update that we had in the quest board. I like it that can be configured to all the missions at the moment only. This one is how to claimable the other ones. We need to review them manually. So I guess Robert time nations are gonna evolve and we're gonna discover. What is gonna be the best

00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: Reviewing process and the best submission type depending on the mission, right?

Robert Del Rey: If you guys have any questions about the outer claimable Mission now, it's a good time before I go to the next update that we did. Go ahead.

Scott Hewitson: So it's the auto claimable is it's obviously not like sending out akt. It's just the XP points. Was that correct? It's Okay.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, you're right. Yeah, let me show my screen real quickly. Let me know when you guys can see it.

Robert Del Rey: okay. You were never gonna see it because I had click on share. All right. So we have the city here. So yeah, the first one it's Auto climbable and it gives you 100 XP points. And since you completed the mission now, you would have access to the other missions. The other missions are They have to still be reviewed manually just but yeah you guessed right if I do this Mission now, I visit this page. And then I click on claim my reward you can see a few seconds. I'm gonna pass first. And then I can claim the reward.

Robert Del Rey: It only gives me the XP point. I'm not gonna click on it. But yeah, it's gonna get through the XP point. No akd it's gonna be sent out almatically to anybody, right?

Scott Hewitson: Sounds good. No, I think that's a good adjustment all made trying to reduce friction as much as possible.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, absolutely. It was a great spot on buying another thing with it the FAQ. See if I can opening up. I have a link here. Yes, I do. Okay. Can you guys see the FAQ? No, just the C, okay. I'm good sharing this stuff. I missed up sharing it's fine. Let me share the link for the document instead. But by the end of the document we added the most freaking questions now the FAQs. With questions, like what is silly? How long does the missions take to be reviewed? When are the akt prices Fade Out?

Robert Del Rey: Do the emissions have to be done on testnet? So all those common questions. We got them now in the proposal document. I just put them there. So if anybody wants to update them, they can update them. I had them on my notion, but I just moved them to this document now, so everybody can see them. But this is just a compilation of the most common questions. We have received since we launched the pilot plus a few more if I need more hair, where do I go? You can ask in their cash CD Discord Channel inside their cache Discord, for example That's a quick one. Collaboration updates about Seeley. I said, I sign up for the newsletter so I can get more information of their plans and the automation stuff.

Robert Del Rey: But I haven't got any answer yet. I will keep you guys posted as soon as I get an answer. That is what remember that if we want to access analytics it since we need a special plan, whatever. I noticed that they do have a paid plan, but it seems that it's not available for everybody. It's just for for a handful of people so I just sign up for the waiting list. I needed a few months back. I just did it again. I tried with another email also. So let's try our look this time.

Robert Del Rey: They also have a collaboration request that you fill out a form and in the form you write things like hey, I just sign up for silly. I open up this community. I'm doing missions this way. I would like to be featured in your pages. So I sent that request also because that way we can get more eyes in the cash Quest sport. I haven't got any answer on that yet. But when I do that what that happened last week, so let's give them more time who know maybe they get a lot of requests. Who knows but as soon as I get something I will let you guys know.

00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: yeah moving On the reviewing process we have had many comments on the review process. I need to chat with Benji so he can let me know how he feels about these. but yeah, we mostly get comments. for example the one we had on Discord early this morning.

Robert Del Rey: That basically the question was why can't the missions be checked in mediately, and what I thought that I didn't send this message, right? I'm telling this to you guys and those who listen to the recording. But the reason why we don't like reviewing and I prove the missions right away, it's because we are not doing this full-time. And especially Benji he's working in his own proposal, and we want to have enough time so we can sit down review the missions and Grant the prices Wasting or without making mistakes on who will give the prices right? That's the reason why we started as a pilot based on your suggestion guys. and yeah, I guess at the moment. This is a learning.

Robert Del Rey: I guess what I wanted to say was our plans for the upcoming Pilots instead of the reviewing process. I need to chat with Benji so he can let me know more insights about it. But what I'm more focused now is that What it's gonna happen after the pilot and I guess This is a great time to talk about extending the pilot or the pilot be 2.0. Like you say some things I wrote down after the pilots is that we have to make sure missions are even clearer

Robert Del Rey: and a specific error, right more specific. we review the missions we did the missions, We thought we had them right but when the missions were out in the field, we start getting those good comments on how to make the missions more clear. So I'm paying attention to those comments and fixing some of the missions accordingly, but one of the things we have to look out for upcoming Pilots, it's making the missions as clear as possible. That's gonna help us in reviewing missions. And that's helps the builders because they're gonna have a clear thing to do instead of guessing what to do. so yeah, that's something for the upcoming pilot. I'm thinking of doing a poll also.

Robert Del Rey: And drop it in the chat so we can gather more comments and more feedback that's gonna happen when we decide to finish the pilot. I guess. It's mandatory to do that. And new type of missions but I'm gonna keep this for another call because this is gonna be long but basically I'm thinking that we can have more missions and we can take advantage of the Discord integration to Grant specific roles to a specific people that do a specific kinds of missions. So it's something I have on my mind and yeah, I guess that we have to discuss this.

Robert Del Rey: In a later time because it's too broad right now for this call. I would like to focus on the reviewing how we're gonna review those missions and I'm happy that when you joined this call, no worries, It's fine. I guess you do jumping in a great time. But the long story short. I was just updating Tyler and Scott on what we've done with the missions. I told them that The first mission is autoclaimable. You don't have to review them now and people can start do the missions right away. I talk about the frequently asked questions. I had those to the

Robert Del Rey: to the Google Document so you can see them by the end of the document. These are the most asked questions that I've seen and I have them all in one single place. So you can see that by the end of the Seeley document Okay, the silly Google Document, I guess that's better.

00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: And the last one that we were talking about is that what we happen after the pilot and Tyler gave us an idea And is that since the holidays are kind of slow on the developer side. Also, the working group calls are slower on during this time of the year Tyler suggests that we should either extend the pilot or do a pilot 2.0 and that way we can give more people more time to complete the missions. I guess. That was the main idea right Tyler. You can correct me if I got it wrong, but that was basically

Tyler Wright: wondering if we could figure out a way to extend the program maybe I don't know if there's any more akt we could theoretically put behind the program to get us another two weeks, but I just want to float the idea. Maybe we can discuss this more next week around having their program at least in this pilot phase continue to January.

Tyler Wright: Fifth, maybe. Yeah that Friday. But yeah, just want to throw that out there to the group.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, I do like the IM before you go Scott. Let me write the dates down. I have two questions, maybe a Scott. You're gonna talk about that. and the question I guess gonna be for Benji. How many akd we have left. To know if we could continue with the pilot. I'm down to extending the pilot of course and your points Tyler are super spot-on like you say, so yeah, I'm down to extending this and using this downtime to have more people even get more chances to get involved with akt with a cash. So the question I have is how many Kitty we have left and How can we go about the missions?

Robert Del Rey: That are pending for review because there are some main missions that are still running some deployments that are still running. and that can take some resources that is related to the comment. We had this morning someone put this is a waste of resources or something like that. I kind of understand where he coming from even if the wording wasn't the best. So I guess those will be my two questions in case we want to extend this program how many we have left and how can we go around the missions we have to review now. Is Scott you had the hands up? Let me…

Scott Hewitson: I'll defer to Benji.

Robert Del Rey: if you don't have any other question.

Scott Hewitson: My question was basically do we have left? How many people do we have ready to be paid out or whatever. But yeah.

Robert Del Rey: So Benjamin it's your turn man. Thanks for jumping in.

Benjamin B: I want to start by I believe that referring to it as a ways to resources is just dependent of what they want to do if they actually want to create a website of Their Own. They would not treat it as a ways to resources. For the budget my loss. Estimate was that we had around 50% to the rewards And this was a high number at the time because I All as if they were going to give out the largest some of the regular missions, so I believe this was to make it cheaper that I counted. the unreviewed missions, however To know for sure how much AKC we have left. We have to review all the missions. And then we need an updated CSV file so I can run the script again.

Benjamin B: So I would say that. after this meeting, I could go through all of the missions while some of the missions should Like the rough idea start we want may not missions to go until the Pilot is over, but if we need to count everything. I think it makes sense to just review them at once then I request the CSV file from Robert. I run the script that I created and I can give the current estimate so we can talk around this for now. how much akt do you think is needed for a pilot version to?

00:20:00

Scott Hewitson: so I guess my thought is if we still have akt left over from the prize pool perspective, then it's really just making sure you guys are compensated for your time. So I know you're putting a lot of effort into this, I don't know if you guys think we need to add more akt to the prizes. I feel like we can kind of do that. As it comes up, but if we're gonna push the effort longer than I definitely want to make sure you guys are compensated for your time and effort that you're putting into it.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you, go ahead Benji.

Benjamin B: Here to what? You said Scott's I think that it makes sense if you guys want to push a pilot version, too. I'm not quite sure if we should just double everything I think that's kind of done without looking into it more. But basically with a new pilot, that's essentially what we're going to do. We have some new knowledge so that we can apply that. we may have some fun over but besides that I think that It's up to you how large you want to create it? We have some stats now available as soon as we have reviewed and so

Scott Hewitson: instead of just Stopping it and then restarting the next one. I mean would it make sense to just extend this one?

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, I believe you would make more sense if we just go. Hey guys. We got massive support.

Scott Hewitson: Yet four weeks.

Robert Del Rey: Can you hear me guys? Okay. Okay.

Scott Hewitson: Yep.

Robert Del Rey: I just gotta like a warning. Saying that I sound low anyway, so what I was saying, yeah, I guess it makes more sense. if we extend the pilot instead of passing delivering rewards and then starting again, especially during this time, which is the holiday time so to make it frictionless as possible. I think we could extend the pilot until December 29th, which is roughly two more weeks. Then we can pay out the rewards the following weeks, which is going to be from January 1st until January 5th, which is Friday the 5th.

Robert Del Rey: About this Friday, which is the 15th. I guess it's a great day to make the announcement. We could announce. I mean since that the pilot it's ending of on these 15th. I guess the 15 is gonna be the best day to let everybody know. It's gonna be extended for two to three more weeks. I don't mind can we do three weeks Tyler says if we can do three weeks until January 5th.

Robert Del Rey: I don't mind. I like how things are going. Like you say, I believe there is momentum going on and like you say Benji. We also learned a few more tricks about silly and what other things we could do. So if you don't mind Benji, if you don't mind Scott, I'm happy to extend this three more weeks until January 5th, and then we deliver the rewards by I don't know mid January any of the day that we can discuss about. Go ahead Benji.

Benjamin B: I think it would be better if we just announced it as soon as we know for sure because that means that the users are not ready to no, it's complete now. We want a rewards but basically the sooner you can give out these use the sooner people will know and can make adjustments accordingly. And then I also want to say that I believe that. Maybe off to the 15th. We could revamp the missions completely. So the first half of the pilot we had some missions. And then we disabled those so people can't complete them at least some of them. And then we have the new ones instead that people could. not create but complete

Robert Del Rey: Or someone. Thank you so much. Hugo is good

00:25:00

Scott Hewitson: Would it be too much effort to so after this call we say all right, we're gonna extend we can do the announcement whatever but then on the 15th when it was originally supposed to end run the script pay out anybody who up to that point and then we know what we for sure have left over and we can use the revamped Mission. So it's an extension with a semi pivot in the middle of it. But then the people who came in and they're expecting it to be done on the 15th and expecting get paid soon after we're still keeping them happy too.

Robert Del Rey: I like that. we can do that and basically do A bill cut and pay whoever is due. We pay them those rewards but they can continue to do the new missions. when you say about revamping the missions,…

Scott Hewitson: Yeah. What do you that Benji?

Robert Del Rey: it's great. It's great.

Benjamin B: Before what was that final thing Scott? I didn't interior.

Scott Hewitson: I was what do you think of that? So essentially, after this call, if we decide we're gonna extend we let people know we're extending but then anybody who's done missions on the existing missions we can run the script and get people paid out shortly after the 15th and then we can kind of pivot tweak or whatever add the New Missions and let it keep going but then we also know how much akt is left over and so it's kind of a mix between a V2 and just an extension, but then s also people are getting paid out on time when they're kind of expecting to

Benjamin B: I think that's a great idea. I could definitely modify The script so that I can get a kitty numbers as well for Robert.

Benjamin B: and then Robert can do the payouts.

Robert Del Rey: I will send you the file right away also. so I had

Benjamin B: Yeah, but we will need the updated one as well later. So. After I've done the reviews today, I will do all on all pending reviews. And after this we can run the numbers again.

Robert Del Rey: German I don't know how you are on time, but I think that if we can get that done between tomorrow Tuesday and Wednesday, is it still gonna be fine? Because I don't know how your agenda looks like today. So don't feel rushed to complete that today. I don't know if you're Scott and Tyler agree, but I guess that reviewing and determine. The akt rewards can be done between tomorrow and Wednesday and we still have enough time to make the announcement and to pay out the rewards what you guys say.

Scott Hewitson: I think that's fine.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah.

Benjamin B: Their worst case scenario. It's still the 21st where the payouts are due. So.

Robert Del Rey: he so yeah, I will go ahead and send you that file right away. As soon as we get those numbers ready. We're gonna make the announcement that we're extending the silly pilot for three more weeks until January 5th. Pay whoever is due for akt rewards and a new missions for the pilot extension. So I guess those are gonna be the deliverables for next week call.

Robert Del Rey: Since we're extending, I guess that's another question. I know you guys gonna go on holiday help me too when I go on holiday. So when should we have the last silly call of the year?

Tyler Wright: I think we have one scheduled for next week. Hopefully we'll make all the decisions this week. We can finalize anything next week and then we can just work async…

Robert Del Rey: e

Tyler Wright: until we might have a full agenda next week in terms of things. We need to cover but Beyond that I think the following Monday after that is New Year.

Robert Del Rey: New Year's Eve Wright

Tyler Wright: Yeah. Yeah. So my boat would be next week and we just take the whole hour and we just make sure we have everything we need heading into the new year because it's like working there.

Robert Del Rey: I agree with that. If you guys agree do some thumbs But where I agree? Hey, George. Thanks for coming So yeah guys besides that any other topics you guys want to go over.

00:30:00

Scott Hewitson: So just want to say so that you guys are adequately compensated. I think it was 250 a piece for the pilot. So I guess we're just trying to figure out a way to come up with a good number that compensates you guys for extra three weeks. So I don't know how long the original Total start to finish would have been I mean if you guys have any ideas on that. I'm all for making, people should be compensated for the time and effort that they put into things but, we don't need to go too crazy with it.

Robert Del Rey: Absolutely, If you don't mind, I can go ahead and send your message offline. And we can take him from there. Yeah. Yeah,…

Scott Hewitson: Perfect.

Robert Del Rey: this is great Thank you guys for your time. I also noted that down to make sure I don't forget about the compensation for the extending time. and yeah, I guess I'm not forgetting anything for now really good call if I can say a little something is that Yeah, it's crazy how things been evolving since we seriously wanted to do this baby. I got to thank you man for pushing me a little in going forward with this. I honestly was kind of like

Robert Del Rey: Gave up, I guess because the first time we didn't have an old support so I didn't want to continue with that. But then I saw how you guys wanted to do it and that inspire me again, and it's crazy how things have people since we again started with this program. It's just a pilot, but we learned so much in these two weeks that I can wait to see how this can complement a cash community and how this is going to look like in the next. I don't know three six months, right? It's exciting. Just wanted to share that with you.

Robert Del Rey: we

Benjamin B: Yeah, thank you for all the kind words Robert. I just want to say that the community program like this is something that I've wanted for a long time for Coach. I didn't even know that Siri was a thing before I talked to Rodrigo. and after that I was thinking in my head this channel has been dead for one or two or three months. How can this be fixed and I help in any way. Can I get
