### Discussion on Extending the Pilot:
- Tyler Wright suggested the idea of extending the pilot or introducing a Pilot 2.0 due to the slower pace during the holiday season.

- Acknowledged the need to review all missions for an accurate assessment of remaining AKT and mentioned the plan to run a script after receiving an updated CSV file from Robert.
- Scott indicated a willingness to add more AKT to the prizes as needed, emphasizing the importance of compensating the team adequately for extended efforts.
- Robert Del Rey thanked Scott for his input and deferred to Benjamin to continue the discussion.
- Benjamin agreed with Scott's perspective, stating that it makes sense to consider compensating the team for extended efforts, especially if there's a decision to push for a pilot version extension.
- Benjamin suggested reviewing all missions after the meeting, requesting an updated CSV file from Robert.

### Considerations for a Pilot Extension:
- Benjamin expressed reservations about doubling everything without further analysis, suggesting that with a new pilot, they could apply new knowledge and potentially make adjustments based on their recent experience.
- Scott Hewitson proposed a hybrid approach, suggesting that after the meeting, if they decide to extend, they can announce it and run the script to pay out participants who completed existing missions around the 15th.
- Scott  proposed the idea of extending the current pilot rather than stopping and restarting, emphasizing the continuity and potential benefits of using the existing momentum.
- Robert suggested extending the current pilot until December 29th, followed by the rewards payout from January 1st to January 5th.
- Tyler suggested a three-week extension, expressing satisfaction with the current progress and momentum.
- Robert agreed with the three-week extension and proposed announcing it on December 15th to provide users with early information.
- Benjamin B proposed revamping missions after the 15th, providing users with a new set of missions for the latter half of the extended pilot.
- Scott suggested running the script on the 15th to pay out users up to that point, providing clarity for those expecting completion on the original end date.
- Scott Proposed a semi-pivot with a script run on the 15th and a continuation with revamped missions for the extended period.
- Benjamin B supported the idea of announcing the extension as soon as it's confirmed, enabling users to adjust their expectations.
- Participants agreed with Scott's suggestion of a script run on the 15th and expressed openness to revamping missions for the latter part of the pilot.
- Decision to announce the extension of the Zealy pilot for three more weeks until January 5th.
- Deliverables for the next week's call include the announcement, payout for AKT rewards, and introduction of new missions for the pilot extension.
