Robert Del Rey: All right, and we Off to the Races Thank you Tyler for the reminder and start recording and Everybody that is here in this call Happy beginning of the week and those listening maybe later. Welcome to the cash silly working group call where we discuss all things about the cash silly initiative. and that the year with a successful pilot and we are in plans of how this is going to look like for the remaining of the year or for the next few months. I guess this call is going to be great to decide a few things. And I wish her the agenda have with you and if you want to add anything to be agenda, feel free to drop it in the chat, or just let me know.

Robert Del Rey: Things I want to cover is the rewards paid out and users and abusers. We got a few cases of maybe people trying to abuse the system and we want to talk about those so we can learn and see how we can manage those. In the next location I can say right away that we haven't paid anybody that we got that we are suspicious on yet. I wanted to wait for these calls so we can all discuss it and maybe get to a consensus the next Topic in the end is gonna be the new missions that we have planned for the month of With the new structure and everything it's gonna go in levels. You're gonna do one Mission then another and then the last mission is gonna be the mission with the rewards. it's gonna be fun.

Robert Del Rey: In the last topic of the agenda. it's raining a lot here guys. I don't know if you can hear it. What is crazy? the last topic of the agenda is gonna be the proposal exposition. we were able to craft a draft with the results of the first pilot how we got there how we ended it and how we plan to continue and how much it's gonna cost. We have Initial Ideas so we can start the real discussions. So yeah, those are the main topics I have unless I think about anything else if you guys have another topic like I said drop in the chat, if not, You can tell me now. If not, I can just go ahead and start right in.

Scott Hewitson: Sounds good.

Robert Del Rey: I said thumbs up. Scott said sounds good. So we have the blessing now. Let's do this. So guys the second pilot ended. On January 5th because of the holidays and other works and that transition period between the holidays and start working again, We waited a few more days to pay the rewards. And just last week I made the announcement that We got the numbers ready for the rewards. In that document we found two users that share a similar email address. And maybe Benjamin can share more details about these abusing cases.

Robert Del Rey: we haven't paid at that person yet, but that was something that happened. We discovered two identities. That was one of the interest instances. and other two There was one girl that I couldn't find in the document in the Winner's document.

Robert Del Rey: But then I was able to find her in the first winner document. So in the first pilot, she actually won a few akt and I checked the history and whatever and we never paid her that But she trying to claimed that last Friday, so I was trying to find her in the latest document that the winners document number two for the second pilot or the extension of the pilot. Sorry, and I didn't find her in that extension document but I went to the first document and I found her there. So I paid the rewards it was a 10K 18 rewards. That was an easy one. The other one was one guy and I'm going to share the screen for this.

Robert Del Rey: the second guy there was a discrepancy in the user. on silly and the user also for the document so in the document

Robert Del Rey: Let me see if you can guess you can see my screen. Yeah. I'm just showing you silly.

Benjamin B: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: So I won't show you the document in this way. Let me do it again. I'm so sorry.

00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: I'mma just go with the entire screen and screen too. All right Okay, you're gonna see my beautiful background. This is something you don't know about me. I love geography like you have no idea guys. and this is one of the best backgrounds I have. I don't know if you can see it. But what I wanted to show you was the winners document to this is the results. It's in my notion. Let me know if you can see it. Can you see it?

Scott Hewitson: Yep.

Robert Del Rey: So this is a user ID that you will have on Sealy. This is related to your silly user. It looks like a hash rate. And yeah, this is related to your username. This is gonna be your username on Sealy. And this is going to be the Discord handle as it says. So what happens I sure the announcement that we had the winners. Please come and claim the rewards some people send me their address. whatever this guy sent me a message shaped bershapi what apps So on this core. It only says beer shop. It doesn't have the e at the end. but when I export the document

Robert Del Rey: it comes out with this e at the end same as the silly username, but on this score, the guy doesn't have that name. It's a British app without the e at the let me know if guys can see it here. You sit here?

Scott Hewitson: Click on their name again because sometimes you can change your display name in a channel, right? Okay.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, this is the original when they text you so the display name is Spirit Shop, and the user is very sharp without the e. so on the document it has

Tyler Wright: And the only difference is the E. Sorry to cut you off.

Robert Del Rey: it's It's okay. Tyler's. Yeah, the only difference it's the E on the username. So what I did was the following and now you will be able to see a cash ceiling. I created One mission specifically for that guy. it's called claim akt reward test and I sent him this Mission and told him be at the end. Go to this Mission and click on the mission. Let me know you mission. So when the guy claimed the mission, I went ahead and exported the document again. In the mission was there. so Okay. It's taking a little while to load. But yeah, this is the guy.

Robert Del Rey: and he did the mission right away. So I don't know if there is an error with the document here. you can see it here. He claimed 30 minutes ago as soon as I sent him the message. He claimed the mission. So even here these courses Bishop B with the e at the end, but on this Korean doesn't have the e. So, I don't know what you guys think about it. I haven't received any other message from a similar account. I just decided to pay the akt after he claimed the mission right away, but I wanted to bring you the story case so you can let me know what you think about this. There are two other abuser instances that maybe bendy can expand a bit more. but yeah, I wanted to share that initially with you guys.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I just want to say that I think that your solution here was quite good because while this might have happened due to maybe a name change or something and there's no one called the beer shape or whatever in the Discord like the linked name. No one has that. so I think it's fine for the other two abusers. I just want to quickly mention that we noticed that they had. Let me share some screenshots actually.

Robert Del Rey: Chairman, go ahead.

Tyler Wright: Cool while you're doing that I see and maybe you can't talk and I'm having a difficulty pronouncing your name. But this is a working group for zealy is an initiative that Robert and Benjamin are leading up as a part of the vanguards and part of the Akash Community to continue to bring more developers into the ecosystem. So I don't know if you have anything that you would like to contribute or any questions that you may have. But I just want to see if the person that just joined has any questions comments or anything that maybe they want to put in chat or just talk about

00:10:00

Benjamin B: All Thank you And back to what I was saying. I sent a link in the chat and I noticed that this guy ninja bus had been using an account on the CLI that was alphotox. This is the same name as another user. So we flagged this as someone with duplicate accounts trying to get multiple Rewards. After they reached out they mentioned that they were brothers, but I don't know how much you should trust people.

Benjamin B: Anyways, these two accounts are linked. That's all we know. Go ahead Tyler.

Tyler Wright: I know Scottish is hand raised, but the only thing I'll say very quickly is we've

Benjamin B: Do you have anything?

Scott Hewitson: Sorry, I wasn't. Yeah, I was just gonna sit like I was going down the same track as tie. we see this all the time at the test net. So anytime there's someone trying to claim at the same email address or we've seen, combinations of it's where so you can clearly tell this is A duplicate and so in that case, the ones that are grouped I pick whichever one is the highest amount of Rewards pay that and then forget everything else, because they did complete a bunch of stuff. Just good. I can pay it and then most of the time to we do it and then nobody ever comes back and complains or if they do then you say what's up with this and then no response, so the second they're just looking for something easy, it's an easy.

Scott Hewitson: easy way to get extra and if you just push back a tiny bit, they'll probably stop and if they don't we can elevate it.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, Okay in that case.

Benjamin B: Yeah. Thank you Scott.

Robert Del Rey: I'm sorry Benjamin real quick to add some context. We did pay ninja base in the first pilot, but we haven't paid anything for what he did in the extension and nothing to the alpha looks account, which is duplicate the abuse account. Just wanted to add that for context.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I think the decision we made is that during the pilot we don't have many rules set right now. I think that we can put the blame on us we can give them the benefit of the doubt because while they're obviously linked it's not like two user free It's not. Done in that way. So I think the minimal rewards paid out is fine for figuring out this rule. So next time we will have a rule that says Max one person per either household or her a computer or something like that or just no duplicate accounts or allowed.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, baby. That's great.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, so far that's all I had on rewards users and have users. It's a funny name Ben if you have anything more about the abusers cases, I can go ahead and move on to the next topic of the agenda. All right. Thank you humbs down. this is a quick demo. For how the new missions are gonna look like if you are on this call or you see this recording later you will get some Alpha and how the missions are gonna look like. And maybe that can give you some heads. So let me know if you can see the Akash Network dashboard the quest board. Sorry.

00:15:00

Benjamin B: I see.

Robert Del Rey: let me remove So this missions they're not color because they're not active. You can see here the label it's draft. I can publish them. But if I publish them people will start to do them. And I don't want that. maybe we publish them on February or whatever. We start the next phase on this program, which is gonna be soon, hopefully and the missions is three missions as you can see here, but this three missions are only one Mission and I will start with the first one so you can understand better. The intro it's gonna be a basic web app in Python and deploy it on a cache intro.

Robert Del Rey: So you have a little intro this is bait or this is based on a great guide that Benji shared with me a few months back and help me to get started a little in this and basically that process I through I mostly went through because I didn't complete it. That is what it's gonna happen in different missions. So this is the first one the intro basically to complete the missions. You need to download these and you download these three programs, whatever.

Robert Del Rey: And after you download the programs. Here says submit your Docker setup profile ID. So once you are done with this, you need to create a Docker desktop account. And to claim this first mission you need to submit your Docker desktop for a file. That's the most basic info I can know right now and it's easy to find if you can think of another piece of information. That they can use to submit this and proof that they downloaded this. Let me know. I'm also thinking that since this is just downloading stuff. This Mission can autovalidates and the guys do them and go to the next mission in the chain. Wanna stop real quick. So you guys can let me know what you think. I see one hand Go ahead brother.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I think as long as we don't try to limit rewards to fit a budget. I think Auto completion here is fine.

Benjamin B: And still have the response so that when they have to write their name, can it just automate anyways.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, yes. Let me show you right I set up in url, but we can change that to empty. And it can validate It just come up with a bottom to claim Mission or we can do text. and they can write whatever they want here

Robert Del Rey: Also, if we are looking for a specific answer we can have a cool down here and they can try again. Maybe one hour later one week later. So yeah, really cool. We can also have a quiz or Paul and we can add a question specifically What's your name? I don't know. This is just improvising and here they can add quite option r or option b But yeah, it's very customizable if that answered your question Benji.

Benjamin B: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, we can do this no Auto validate draft and you go. Here is it?

Robert Del Rey: You see It's number box that they can write and after they write they click on claim, but I can claim because I'm an admin but you get the picture guys. no, no, okay. Okay. Are we here?

Robert Del Rey: Can you guys hear me? Okay, okay.

Benjamin B: Yes.

Scott Hewitson: Still can hear you?

Robert Del Rey: Thanks for a second. I felt like the electricity was out.

Robert Del Rey: There were problems I guess no worries. So we continue this is gonna be like the intro it's gonna be Auto validating. I believe it's a great option. So people don't waste time and they can continue to the next mission in the chain. It's gonna be the same title, but now it's creating and testing your web app. And now you can see how this is turning a bit more fun. Because now if you can do this it's because you did the other steps in the missions the second step is this now you're gonna create the environment for the application in Visual Studio or something like that being explained to me.

00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: I'm pretty sure that we're gonna get lots of questions in their cash daily. Hopefully that's the case. But this is how the mission would look guys. You have all the commands here and you have a description what's gonna do and the steps if they read this in order they would be able to do it. But if they jump from here to the last part they won't be able to do it in my opinion. So you have to follow the guide. And this is the example with Benji's guide, but I believe we can fit anything a cash related in this format. And that is one question I had for you Scott and Tyler or maybe for others in overclocks, like what?

Robert Del Rey: What are the things that you would like to see being develop the most in a cache and maybe we can focus on that for one or two months and do missions that support that goal or for our clocks or for the cash Community if that makes sense, I believe it does. So yeah going down to the submission method. I just did three x because I don't know what would be like the best roof. I believe I screenshot will do or maybe one copy of the code. I don't know Benjamin what do you think about it? But that's basically it. and the third mission it's like the last You made it all. This is the final step. Now we're gonna containerize test and upload the application that these guys did.

Robert Del Rey: You have here create a file and the name Below Docker image you got the comment the commands you got everything and then the last part is run it on a cache.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, I'm very happy to see how they actually look way prettier than the first missions. I don't know if that's gonna do something. But if I was a super developer or maybe a beginning developer, I would like to see this instructions and the content I'm gonna use in the CLI or the environment whatever. But yeah, I like the way it looks that's one personal note. I want to leave there. Please help me with the submission type. I don't know Benji. What would you like to see submitted? It's gonna be like their application, but maybe we should have some guidelines not to leave it so open. on the first pilot, but leave it

Robert Del Rey: openly enough that people can do their stuff and build on a cash and run on a cash and it's still claim the missions maybe for the last mission and this is something I just thought maybe they won't win rewards right away and we can get a few submissions like five ten people do this and we can review what is the best application and maybe that one can take the final price? yeah, I leave that to the floor. So yeah, maybe what's up, man?

Benjamin B: So let me start with the last idea you had I think that it makes sense to have some rewards like that. I think there should be a bit of both for some there should be the best if you create a video for example, maybe just record the best and also to speak on how I should have this Mission so I think for the first one we can collect the Username and have it all to complete this gives us some data and we can go track and see how successful as this Mission bin for the second one. Maybe a screenshot, but we're not going to pay out rewards for your step to I'm guessing so. If they do a screenshot or not, it doesn't really matter. So I think they should just be allowed to go do the next step if they want to.

Benjamin B: And for the last one, I think that either we can have some guidelines set so that they have to keep it on mine for a minimum of a few days or something. So we have time to review. or we can And send us A screenshot maybe we can also well validate it to their username. So if they have their Docker username we can see uploaded an image that works and then we will also see the screenshot that They also did deploy it.

00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: Awesome, and thanks for the input. I will do the changes and have them reflected in mediately. Thank you so much, And yeah that's all for the new and demo Tyler. Go ahead man.

Tyler Wright: It's not like that was really awesome. I know that you ask for some feedback from the overclock Labs theme. At the highest level one. It would be great if you could share and I know you haven't gotten to that part yet, but the second discussion and the proposal for the next steps. so that he and I can take that internally and continue to push it forward with some other thoughts because I think at the highest level what zealy is trying to do and I think overclock Labs is trying to do that. And so it's a cash Community is we want to find more.

Tyler Wright: vanguards and power users like yourself, if you want to find more Benjamin's we want to find more Roberts more Rodrigo's more shimpas or julius's and I think using zealy at the vehicle to get folks like that into the community is a great idea. at the highest level, I know that's what with eat Denver and a number of those conferences that members of the community and the core team will be going to trying to figure out dockerizing specific Layer Two or the East project and running their nose on the Akash Network and building svls that make it easy for other folks to do that. It's something that is very interesting and obviously anything

Tyler Wright: An running specific AI hugging face models on a cache could be an interesting challenge to bring out more technical users to understand that kind of stuff similar to Julius. But again, I can write that more. I can write that down. But I just want to put that on record of something like high level things that I know the coaching to think about. I'm sure you might have some others again.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks thing.

Scott Hewitson: No, thank you covered it well.

Robert Del Rey: awesome

Robert Del Rey: Yeah said Cindy Robert I wrote some but yeah, if you're free to send those over you can send me at the end if you want to send them in the CBD score, but whatever Thanks for those suggestions were really nice. I wrote some myself to and I believe now we'll be perfect time to start going over about the proposal and plan the next steps four days or maybe people and start the next phase of this. I don't know you're gonna call it still.

Robert Del Rey: If you want to go over the proposal and I support you. That'd be nice if you can take over the second segment of this call. If you're ready, of course.

Benjamin B: Yeah, Thank you Robert. I mean Let me share my screen.

Robert Del Rey: everybody

Benjamin B: so I have not published this to GitHub yet because

Benjamin B: I don't think it's quite red. I think that we should go over this and try to agree on some stuff. I wrote this draft just before the weekend and I wrote some resources. I think we need and just a general overview of how it could look like. I'm not sure if this is enough. I don't know if this is too much. Do you want a few minutes to read through this everyone?

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Scott Hewitson: I'll read it real quick.

Tyler Wright: Is this in a state where you can send out a draft? Just or whatever.

00:30:00

Robert Del Rey: I guess we can go over the basics while you still see these craft…

Benjamin B: Sure, I can do that.

Robert Del Rey: but basically it talk about Seeley what it is what we have done so far and how the pilot went. And what we're going to focus specifically is. if the resources required are

Robert Del Rey: maybe good enough for the community so we can post this and start getting the conversations going. and I'm more specifically interested in the spec that outcomes and I like brainstorm to come up with these outcomes, but cause I love to hear your guys perspective from overclock perspective and make sure the outcomes we're working towards to are aligned to the outcomes that you guys want to see in our clubs and that the broader Community wants to see so yeah, basically at least personally what I would like to focus on right now in this discussion is the resources required and the expected outcomes.

Robert Del Rey: Basically, but that's me. I don't know Benji if you would like to focus on other topics outside those Scott or Tyler the rest of the participants, right?

Tyler Wright: I think that makes the most sense for me. I think Benjamin does a good job of laying down the foundation and the whole story and so I can read that but I think the outcomes and how much to ask is the most important thing to talk about

Tyler Wright: Scott you have your hand raise?

Robert Del Rey: Go ahead.

Scott Hewitson: No, I'm just reading through this. No, I mean I think we did the pilot and you just quickly go over high level results. what did we learn from the pilot? it says 925 akt was rewarded between 22 or 25 Mission 76 users. Do we see any of those users hanging around in Discord more or is anybody But is people to come do it and then leave we want to try to make it somewhat sticky.

Scott Hewitson: Go ahead.

Rodrigo Rochin: So yeah, like I said in our last silly meeting call. I have seen more people after the Silicon paint in this court. And it does look like some of them are staying I did also say that I was a little skeptical about silly. but it seems it's working and Robert and Ben are doing a great job.

Scott Hewitson: No,…

Robert Del Rey: Thank you so much, brother.

Scott Hewitson: I mean I missed the last call. So sorry if any of that was discussed. But yeah, no, I think at least from my perspective, some people don't know what zealy is or whatever. So if we do put this forward you Say hey, this is a developer onboarding program or something a little more broad that I mean, we're using zealy as the tool to do it. But just to get wider support from Community validators. Whoever if you say hey, we're trying to bring on new developers and look we've already done that through these Pilots. It's just further bolsters the narrative or the case to get money.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, I like the name. Also. You said the developer onboarding program, right?

Scott Hewitson: So yeah, something like that.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Yeah, I like that because sometimes I think yeah It's been helping us doing those missions, but I don't want to see getting in the way and become an obstacle for people to onboard Akash it's great. How silly help us do these but yeah, like you say Scott. I don't like the focus to be on silly or to have people think too much about silly. So I guess it's great if we start the Also saying instead of silly. It's a community growth to whatever.

Robert Del Rey: This program is a developer onboarding program using silly and that's it. And I believe that that will be even more powerful to introduce the document in my honest opinion and that way we don't Focus like that much on silly because everything is done through silly. So it has enough participation I guess in this program. Thank you for that.

00:35:00

Scott Hewitson: Yeah, and then I also kind of opens you up to if there's other ideas or options to explore getting the high level goal of onboarding more developers than you kind of have a little leeway to do so.

Robert Del Rey: thanks, go ahead and

Benjamin B: Yeah, I think not limiting. Everything to seal is a great idea because what happens if you just want to host a fun fun little sponsored contest, so I've had this example idea in mind for some time. imagine that we want to bring over web to Developers. We for example team up with some game developer influencers who could help share game jump and then to this users we could sponsor their server so we could help them Host Game Servers. Just as an example that could not be done through silly in the same way.

Benjamin B: Go ahead rodr.

Rodrigo Rochin: Yeah, like you'll say and like I said, I was a little skeptical about silly especially because I didn't think that there's many developers there and I do see how silly helps you out to manage this program and makes it easy and there are tons of users there. Although I thought or think that they're mostly just nothing folks What's it called? Let's scavengers the People just looking for airdrops and stuff. but yeah,…

Robert Del Rey: this bounty hunters

Rodrigo Rochin: maybe they're there. They Bounty Hunter. Yeah, so it could be used silly with another platform or another tool where there are more developers. I'm not sure which one but of their properties one

Robert Del Rey: Go ahead Tyler. You got your hand up.

Tyler Wright: The only thing that I'll add and I don't think there's anything wrong zealy. I see other communities also using zealy. So to Scott's point. I do agree that focusing on just the developer onboarding is the most important but we could talk about the kind of communities you really has and all that kind of stuff just as a starting point and to everyone's point we can switch later. I think to Scott's point about stickiness. I think that's one of the things that we have to make sure that whatever platform we use we're making sure that there's a path for zealy users. So we're getting people from zealy Community to get really interested in the cash or other communities once we get them interested and once we have them doing something where do we push some next and I think that's just as important as doing the missions because

Tyler Wright: than whether it's into the Discord or whether it's having them do more bounties. we just want to keep them in the community and keep them building for as long as possible. So I think that's something very important to think about and continue to focus on as a part of this experience.

Tyler Wright: I'm sorry real quick or whether it be like the hackathon, there's all these other programs that are, getting community pool funding right now. I think it'd be great to Showcase zealy's power and pushing people into Hackathons pushing people into working groups and cigs pushing people into the Discworld communities that they join the Insiders or eventually join the vanguards, and if those are things that are actively being thought about and being pushed I see no reason why this wouldn't be something that everybody in the community understands and wants them back, because again, we're already using the existing programs that Adam has worked so hard to build, and others and we're just again using zealy at the vehicle to continue to push people into those programs.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, though. Yeah, we'll definitely put more thought on those points you say and how we're gonna retain those talents because how much over 76 users interacted downloaded stuff and did something on a cache. So we should be able to keep at least a percentage of those people and make them inside. There's make them vanguards or make them just normal community members, but they are there on these corn telegram supporting else so yeah, I guess we demonstrated that we can use the tool now. The next critical point is how we're gonna

00:40:00

Robert Del Rey: turn those testers or users into a cash community members, I believe we are aligned there, Yeah, I'm sure we are. It's gonna be a great news if we can do that. Go ahead Benji. I'll see you.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I want to add something to what the rotor was saying. I don't think that we should just have the celebrating users trust. I think that a big portion of this is that we have to find users so we can decide a little longer on how we are supposed to do that. But just relying on a platform to give us organic users. I think that's not enough and on a Reddit. We can try to Market on Twitter and then we can try to Market through. all other sorts of Medias but I think that.

Benjamin B: The success we have had now, I think that's without almost any marketing at all. So I think if we start to actually push the marketing initiatives, I think this can scale up really well and we can try to Target real users who or developers but then also if we find people that are not Developers as long as we shape the missions, so it doesn't matter. And then we can have any users and how much they want to learn is up to them. So, I don't know if you were here earlier in the cold Rodrigo. But basically we discussed one of the new missions that we're going to release. And if you're not a developer and you have never touched a command line or never touched a script.

Benjamin B: There's a big chance you won't be able to complete it or at least you will. Be scared from it. However, if someone wants to learn, I think that even if they are a developer before a cost or not, as long as they're willing to learn how it works and maybe get an interest for Akash after that. I think it's good enough.

Tyler Wright: So real quick,…

Robert Del Rey: Absolutely.

Tyler Wright: I do want to add to that point that Benjamin made because I think it's worth talking about. I know that Adam has been thinking about to continue to improve the onboarding experience for people that are like vanguards or there's General people that come into the chat and hey, they want to learn more. I love the idea of zealy being an option because some people just may want to learn on their own and we can send them to the docs. We can send them to Cloud most we can send them to pray or we can do a number of options. But some people maybe we need to be incentivized and zealy because there'll be funds behind it. could back. All right here this guy get started and potentially get paid, and maybe we'll get a whole batch of folks that come in that way earn a couple AKA now that they have that akt they can use it,

Robert Del Rey: I can go ahead. this is an open stage. At least for you guys. You're like the founders of this project. So if you want to say something just jump in.

Benjamin B: Of course.

Benjamin B: Anyways, I just wanted to say that I think there's been enough time to go through this. I think you've had 15 or 20 minutes to read for this now.

Benjamin B: I'm asking Easter anything you want to add besides there was some things discussed here about the expected outcomes, especially related to things such as insiders program and working groups. Vanguards Etc. How do you all feel like should we change anything here? Should we add something more besides that we want to try to focus even more on this we have missions. And then what do you think about the funding? I don't think this is a huge ask for the community pools size. But maybe it's a bit much for this specific proposal. I want some feedback on everything here on whether or not you agree or not. Go ahead Roberts.

00:45:00

Robert Del Rey: Thanks ji. Maybe just for the record you can just say how much will it be for the length of the campaign or how much we think will be enough and for how many months we plan to do this?

Rodrigo Rochin: yeah, I hadn't read the document generating it now, so

Scott Hewitson: Just quick question,…

Tyler Wright: but I'll go ahead.

Scott Hewitson: You want it? I got it. All right, so I'm just looks like two people 500 bucks a week because it's 250 a week or per person per week for 2500 USD a month. Where's the extra 500 bucks? Just I see. 500 a week times four weeks two grand I think is completely reasonable. for How many months a quarter?

Benjamin B: Everything is for a quarter and these are rewards this would be for each user here.

Scott Hewitson: Okay.

Scott Hewitson: So wouldn't it be six grand for the quarter because two grand a month. I know that's really nitpicky. But

Benjamin B: Let me see. two weeks in a year divided by 4 times 250

Scott Hewitson: five I guess yeah going off of weeks versus months.

Benjamin B: to be a free files into 250 per person. By my calculations, it's correct. Let me show you here.

Scott Hewitson: No, that's fine. I mean if you're going off of weeks versus I was just going off a month four weeks in a month, but not every month has exactly four weeks. So

Benjamin B: Yeah, I was going by the hours and USD power so it would be accurate and by the quarter

Scott Hewitson: Gotcha. No,…

Robert Del Rey: But I think that's a great.

Scott Hewitson: I think this is fine.

Robert Del Rey: I just got sorry.

Scott Hewitson: no, I was just gonna add so we have the five grand a month in rewards. This is just an idea but not saying we have to do it which is wildly under underutilized. So if anyone out there has any ideas and wants to do stuff, please let's spend some more money, it's like if that's not getting used we could use that. I don't know if we can use that for rewards until it starts getting used more. But I think this ask is completely fine. I don't have any issues with it. I think it's reasonable. we've been transparent as long as we got the steering committee on Thursday. I don't know how you feel about turning something quick and getting it out there, but I think it would be really nice to be able to bring this up and steering committee for, carve out.

Scott Hewitson: Four or five minutes at Ty can squeeze it in there to say. Hey, this is what we're thinking and the goal is to get more developers to get more folks building on a cost and by the way, we have some proof that some of it works and we have some more people in here. But time is of the essence since steering committee is on Thursday if we want to get it in, I'm just thinking trying to get full support from community and the steering committee.

Tyler Wright: I would agree with that.

Benjamin B: awesome

Robert Del Rey: Thanks.

Tyler Wright: I think the ask is more than reasonable. And if we can get this online and start to get folks Rodrigo great. It'd be great to get your thoughts on it, especially

Tyler Wright: when people say I didn't think this gonna work but that makes everyone feel good. But yeah, if we can start getting comments on here I can add some and hopefully we could talk about this on Thursday. I forget it in the next day or so, then I'll make sure we talk about it on Thursday.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, I can.

Rodrigo Rochin: And also really sounds great.

Robert Del Rey: Go ahead and…

Robert Del Rey: really sorry.

Rodrigo Rochin: Sounds reasonable and…

Rodrigo Rochin: like I said, I do see more users in this court.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, And thank you Tyler and Scott. We're gonna reward this to make sure we add the topics that you mentioned how we can use this to retain more people the developer on boarding program and maybe we can work with the wording on the funding. so there is no confusion because I believe there was a confusion between what is Scott was reading and what Benji was trying to explain in the funding. So maybe we could work the word in a little but yet you can add it to the agenda for this Thursday. I'll be happy to go over this and finally present this to the rest the brother Community if that makes sense and what had Benjamin

00:50:00

Benjamin B: Thank I was going to mention kind of the same things. I will be going over some of the things with mentioned in the cold today. And this discussion will be up today with the changes. I will make it so that the focus is it's clear that we might go away from Sealy if we think it's required. I will elaborate what seal is. I will reward a couple of things like this. And do you really think that this needs to be rewarded? I think that and All in all is pretty clear, but Maybe just because you didn't have time to go over it. It created the confusion.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I don't think it needs to be reworded all that much and…

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, that's a great point.

Tyler Wright: I don't even think you need to put an emphasis on the idea of potentially moving away for zealy. I think you can focus on it's a developer onboarding program. Zealy is what we're using and if somebody wants to come back and back. I think we should use this program or okay, let's do the research. But again zealy is shown that there's a community there and the pilots have been successful. So I don't want to just make people have to make more decisions. We'll move forward with zealy until others say have better guidance,

Tyler Wright: But yeah,…

Benjamin B: also

Tyler Wright: I think just the structure is good. I would just add the stuff about the six working groups. I would add more information about the onboarding experience and how we want to potentially Market this get people that join the community to leverage zealy to earn as a path earn rewards and learn more about Akash and then that stickiness, after they complete the program how we push them into other things and those outcomes of again finding more Roberts Benjamin's Rogers CJ simpos. I'm sure I'm leaving on a number of folks in the community, but that's just a few of key. is that are accountable build a number of different ways both technically and not technically and just support the growth of the community if we can find

Tyler Wright: four more five more each of you. I think we'll be in a really really good place.

Benjamin B: Also, thank you for this. I will also mention that we agreed that during this call that the details or reasonable.

Scott Hewitson: Yeah, I think to ask amount. I think it's perfectly reasonable

Benjamin B: Adele's come out the expected outcomes Etc.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I think this is.

Rodrigo Rochin: You could look fine like sorry.

Tyler Wright: N't. No no,…

Tyler Wright: go ahead Roger.

Rodrigo Rochin: They're like Tyler's there anything this doesn't need much rewarding anymore and…

Rodrigo Rochin: it would be great to push it on Thursday and have it going this quarter.

Robert Del Rey: Sounds like a deal. Thank you guys for your input.

Scott Hewitson: I think maybe one thing to add It's just at the end of it. Just give a report just some kind of transparency of hey, This is what the results were after it was done so that we go back to ask your more for another quarter. Then people can make educated decisions.

Robert Del Rey: Let's go also based on that I believe. Benji we should go ahead and have the cell file with the previous winners and how much we have paid so far. I believe that's also a good piece of information to have there.

Benjamin B: If you could send all the relevant links you want to add here I could add them.

Robert Del Rey: Sure, you got All right, you're righty. I would say this has been a really solid call guys. Thank you for joining and thank you for your time also for those listening to the recording. Thank you, and please get involved. I don't have anything more to add so far. I believe the points were great. and there is some thinking we're gonna do Benji you and this week until Thursday, but yeah, it seems that first is gonna be the day that we reveal ourselves to the community, but knowing the way that you thinking and So guys, yeah, that's all for me. Unless you have anything else that you want to add before we wrap this up?

00:55:00

Benjamin B: Queer employment. Thank you everyone. I'm super appreciative of these calls.

Robert Del Rey: Awesome. thanks everybody.

Tyler Wright: Please thank you. All this is amazing really excited for the future.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah. Yeah, let's see how it goes, right? Thank you for joining us. Stay safe and until next time guys, okay?

Rodrigo Rochin: integral great job that you guys

Scott Hewitson: All right.

Robert Del Rey: you see

Benjamin B: Bye everyone.
