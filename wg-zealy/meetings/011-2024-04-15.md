Robert Del Rey: Happy Monday. a cash community I hope your weekend was fine. And welcome to the Akash silly working group call. Today's agenda is a picture. Mostly we'll cover some updates about things we did last week. Things we want to do for the remaining of the month.

Robert Del Rey: and yeah in our objects about silly.

Robert Del Rey: Since this school is going to be short and Only me. The good thing is we're gonna have the recording and transcript or everybody to catch up later.

Robert Del Rey: So silly updates the rewards for the first Sprint. Have been paid. I believe only three four winners playing their rewards yet. They claim window and that last Friday the 12th. so if you didn't claim suddenly you will lose those Rewards.

Robert Del Rey: So the claiming window is close. Hey Ty GM.

Tyler Wright: M how are you?

Robert Del Rey: I'm doing good. I just started the recording honestly and was just covering silly updates. So you haven't missed.

Robert Del Rey: How you doing? How was your weekend?

Tyler Wright: Not bad at all. Yeah, but real complaints. How about you?

Robert Del Rey: Awesome, That's good to hear my weekend. I changed the office today as you can see. I'm sitting in the living room now. But my weekend was okay.

Tyler Wright: excellent

Robert Del Rey: Man, I went to the groceries. And I bought some more lamps to the house. Hopefully I get them installed this week, but not much action, honestly. Besides that as far as my personal life goes,…

Tyler Wright: 

Robert Del Rey: right the crypto Market was full of action this weekend as I can see lots of volatility, But yeah man happy we live to fire another day.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, yeah exactly.

Tyler Wright: exactly

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, as I was covering rewards for versus Sprints were paid 97% of the rewards were paid only for people playing their Rewards. moving on a Sprint number two Benji and I shot it this last week about how the current missions are doing. And we also bring storms some ideas for upcoming missions.

Robert Del Rey: Last week we did something new. We had the first silly Q&A session. We had a last Friday and we wanted to have a space where people can come in and ask questions and overall sure the experience they have with Sealy. We had some inputs by recommunity members some of them suggested New Missions some of them wanted missions from the first months to be in this month. and overall. It was really cool here in them and how they feel about this. so yeah. We're working on getting some more New Missions So That's it. Again, it was very fruitful at first. It was only Benji and I but then more people trickle in.

Robert Del Rey: And it was fruitful for all of us. Some things we got sorted out list this last week ahara called with the silly team. To ask some questions about collaboration between communities. And they provide us some things we can do. They have the silly API documents. and in a nutshell basically you can integrate Seeley with your apps how in a way that you can make people interact with your apps and I will give them XP points and stuff. So basically they tell us if we want silly to feature us we have to do at least one Seeley API Quest

00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: Showy case showcasing how we are using silly in our community. So Benji and I are still shaping that up. Let's see how that goes. But that's the main update we got from Seeley. I also share some feedbacks about using the platform. For example. One is the Analytics. I can see all the analytics all time the last three months the last 30 days and the last seven days. But I'm not able to see the information by a Sprint. For example, if we did the first Sprint and we want to see the analytics only for that first Sprint that is not possible in the current analytics settings. So I share that feedback with them they liked it and they told me they will get back to me on this…

Tyler Wright: What?

Robert Del Rey: but they really like that feedback seems nobody suggested it before.

Tyler Wright: how are you?

Robert Del Rey: How am I?

Robert Del Rey: it's okay. I thought you were asking me how am I I'm good, by the way, I'm good.

Robert Del Rey: But yeah, as I was saying seems nobody suggested it before hopefully they get back with me this week. another feedback that I had is that when we click on the missions to have a specific info on the missions. It's not possible to see how many people did Mission In detail, I'm not able to see that I only can see all the people that did all the missions but I'm not able to see a stats by missions neither. So that was another feedback that I gave them and they were kind of surprised of that. But yeah, yeah still lots of learning even though we're almost two months in these official campaign. I still were learning by we're doing this. anyway

Robert Del Rey: So that's all I have for the agenda. Honestly the updates we did the catch-up calls. We had last week the Q&A session. We had the last week. and the guidance about current missions and getting some ideas for New Missions and existence. For example, one of the missions that people want us to bring back is create web app using python. The first mission in the first Sprint was really Just create a simple web app, but two guys in the community were asking for something more complex to do but I still

Robert Del Rey: up They wanted something more complex to do is still on python. So they still want to try things on python but a bit more complex than just creating the web application and deploying it on a cache. So we're still trying to figure out how is that going to look like? But yeah again, it was a really nice call. initially. We wanted to be 30 minutes in the call and we extended it for an hour and five minutes. We didn't record it sadly. But maybe next time. So yeah, yeah. yeah, that's all I have for now. I was chatting with Benji sadly. He won't be able to join this meeting. He is actually getting super busy with the providers audit stuff.

Robert Del Rey: I'm also super easy with the cash hackathon that is going full esteem. So yeah, yeah. that's that on the silly GitHub. I was able to speak with George Tyler and I believe he's been helping me updating the calls and adding the call notes in the silly GitHub repo, which is super welcome. Thank you George for your help. And by the way, Sac were asking about the emails and the newsletter and stuff. There is a mission template to request just that sign up to our newsletter. and it's information with a text box where people just need to input their email and

Robert Del Rey: and we can see that email and sign them up in whatever newsletter. We're offering but they have a mission specific for that. I believe Zach is gonna like that mission. Other than that, yeah, that's all I have again really short maybe for the attendance, but still I'm happy we're recording this so people can catch up with this later on. The next working group call we're gonna have it's right before we and the second Sprint and that's gonna happen this month April 29th the the same place.

00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: So with that being said Tyler if you don't have any questions, I don't have any other update to give what I will work in this quick. Like I said is if silly comes back to me with this feedback I gave them. If not, that's okay, working in the New Missions for the third and last Sprint we're gonna have a combination from Miss. We had in the first Sprint and meet a new missions ideas we plan to do on this. Third coming up Sprint one thing I want to clarify and this is a bit of topic. This is something I was sharing with Adam offline because we have a silly Quest that is kind of similar to one of the hackathon tracks. There is a Fiat.

Robert Del Rey: Sorry Sorry Fiat wakash on ramp track on the hackathon. and we have a Fiat to a cash silly Mission. So I thought I add them the main difference is that In the silly Quest we are just asking for a prototype. Doesn't matter how you do it. If you find a way to do a Fiat on ramp that helps people buy akt using your credit card. Doesn't matter if it looks ugly if it looks good.

Robert Del Rey: If it works that is what we're looking for in the Q&A session, actually, we clarify to the participants that it's open to them how they want to reach that goal. However, the difference with the hackathon is that you have some very clear guidelines on how the cash Community wants distract to be completed on the hackathon. So I believe that that is the main difference. That is what I explained He understood completely so if you thought there was conflict in those missions there is not They are similar in name, but they're requesting two different results, honestly, and also the required it's way low in the hackathon. You have three rewards, I believe it's 5,000 10,015,000 for the Sealy. It's gonna be only one winner and it's gonna be only 250 akt

Robert Del Rey: which is like

Robert Del Rey: like a thousand something dollars with today's prices. So yeah. and I believe that is the last meaningful of date I can give you right now. I don't know if you have any extra comment or something outside the topic you want to share with me. If not, I guess we can call it a call for today. I should say.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, no. No, I think you're doing a great job. It sounds like there's a lot of momentum. The only thing I would say is maybe as we prep for the next steering committee meeting. It'd be great to get an update on all thank you all doing that might get moved from the last week of April to the first week of May. But again, other than that, it's just you all are doing a great job. So Yes, many people as we can push towards the hackathon even from zealy would be great because it's like additional opportunities to get involved. But overall. I know I'm very happy with how the zealy program is being run and how it's moving forward. So excited to continue to get some of those folks from zealy more active in the community and more engaged.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you so much I'll make sure I have a good report for you guys in the steering Community called in the monthly sitting Community called because it's good that Maybe I can bring to you The total amount of community members, we have the new community members we have after we started the Sprint so we can get the pile of the pilot data out because we shared that I believe one or two months ago and I can just share with you the results from a sprint number one and a sprint number two. And you can stay up to speed on that one.

Tyler Wright: That would be perfect.

Robert Del Rey: So that's gonna be my homework from this call. Okay?

Tyler Wright: But that would be perfect.

Robert Del Rey: Awesome Thai thank you for sharing this time with me And also for those listening to the recording if you have any questions, remember, the place is their cash silly working group chat. If not, you can also send me at the end directly having more than happy to answer all your questions. And with that being said I just wish you an excellent start of the week. And yeah, let's keep on hunting. All right.

00:15:00

Tyler Wright: Thank you, Robert.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you. Bye. Okay. See you around man.

Tyler Wright: All right. See you around.
