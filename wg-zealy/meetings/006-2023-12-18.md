## Meeting Notes
### Progress Updates:
##### Robert Del Rey:
- Acknowledgment and gratitude to Benjamin for creating a script to determine winners.
- Benjamin's script: Analyzing participant data - number of participants, missions, XP points, and AKT rewards.
- Mentions having an Excel file with participant details.
- Discussion on publishing the document, addressing privacy concerns, and missing addresses in the published link.
- 20 participants earned AKT prizes in the two-week pilot period.
- Mention of participants who won 45 AKT each; average winners received around 20 to 25 AKT.
- Overview of the distribution of AKT rewards, with the highest earner receiving 45 AKT and the lowest earner receiving 10 AKT.
- Discussed the review process for missions and ensuring deserving participants receive rewards.

#### Benjamin B
- Reviewing missions was straightforward for Benjamin, leveraging his knowledge to assess deployments.
- Criteria for approval included checking for an active deployment through provided links and correct screenshots.
- Identified challenges in the provider mission where unclear specifications led to difficulties in evaluating submissions.
- Some users faced issues with outdated software installations or improper provider setups, requiring clarification on expectations.
Feedback for Extension:
- Proposed having more advanced goals in the pilot extension rather than repeating the same missions.
- Discussed the need for clearer instructions for missions, especially those related to providers.
- Encouraged a variety of missions to enhance the learning and experimentation experience for participants.
### Winner Reward Claim Process
- Robert shared that he received 19 private message requests related to the winners of the first phase of the Zealy pilot.
- Proposed two ways to handle winners claiming rewards: manually reviewing DMs or creating a new mission for winners to submit their addresses.
- Benjamin suggested incorporating address submission in the first mission to avoid complications later.
- Robert agreed with Benjamin's suggestion and highlighted the simplicity of modifying the existing mission for address submission.
- The group agreed on the approach of integrating address submission in the initial mission.

### New Missions Discussion
- Robert Del Rey emphasizes the need to raise the bar and introduce more challenging missions for participants.
- Benjamin proposes continuing existing missions with modifications and introduces new, more specialized ones to engage active community members.
- Benjamin's First Mission Idea: Participants create and deploy a project from scratch, moving beyond using existing deployment templates.
- Benjamin's Second Mission Idea: Create a new validator, aiming for a top 100 position or at least being active on the GitHub discussions page. Acknowledges the need for further refinement.
- Tyler Wright supports the idea of encouraging validator participation but suggests refining the timing and details of the second mission.
- Mission 3: Detailed mission on becoming a provider, including specs, GPU, and uptime requirements.
- Mission 4: Rewarding users for active participation in GitHub discussions, encouraging research posts and engagement.
- Mission 5: Creating well-edited short videos demonstrating how to deploy specific topics (e.g., React apps, Python projects) to Akash.
- Tyler suggests an "Integrations Mission" as a more open-ended challenge. Participants could figure out an integration into a storage solution, with rewards ranging from $300 to 500 AKT. It would essentially be a small hackathon.
- Tyler raises a concern about incentivizing comments on GitHub discussions, suggesting it may lead to insincere or unnecessary contributions.
- Tyler emphasizes the importance of encouraging providers to consider features like IP lease and persistent storage.

### Ideas for "Integration Mission":
- Tyler Wright supports the idea and adds to it by suggesting future missions that encourage building integrations with other projects like Filecoin, storage, and other decentralized infrastructure projects.
- Tyler envisions creating missions that simplify workflows and provide references for integrating Akash with various storage solutions, contributing to a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.
- Robert Del Rey confirms Tyler's suggestion, summarizing it as creating missions that encourage building storage solutions on Akash for projects like Filecoin, with specific rewards tied to the integration.

#### Closing Comments
#### Robert Del Rey:
- Affirms the plan to extend the pilot until January 5th.
- Highlights the urgency to finalize new missions, rewards, and communicate the extension to the community.
- Thanks the team for their contributions and participation.
- Encourages members to reach out for questions or discussions on Discord or Telegram.
## Action Items
- Group to explore the possibility of an "Integrations mission", defining criteria and potential rewards.
- Benjamin to refine and finalize the proposed mission concepts
- Robert to focus on shaping and refining the proposed missions into actionable tasks for implementation.
- Robert to explore the possibility of attaching rewards to successful friend invites, considering feasibility and tracking challenges.
- Group plan to run the extended pilot until January 5th.
