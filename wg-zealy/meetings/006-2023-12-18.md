## Meeting Notes
### Progress Updates:
##### Robert Del Rey:
- Acknowledgment and gratitude to Benjamin for creating a script to determine winners.
- Benjamin's script: Analyzing participant data - number of participants, missions, XP points, and AKT rewards.
- Mentions having an Excel file with participant details.
- Discussion on publishing the document, addressing privacy concerns, and missing addresses in the published link.
- 20 participants earned AKT prizes in the two-week pilot period.
- Mention of participants who won 45 AKT each; average winners received around 20 to 25 AKT.
- Overview of the distribution of AKT rewards, with the highest earner receiving 45 AKT and the lowest earner receiving 10 AKT.
- Discussed the review process for missions and ensuring deserving participants receive rewards.

#### Benjamin B
- Reviewing missions was straightforward for Benjamin, leveraging his knowledge to assess deployments.
- Criteria for approval included checking for an active deployment through provided links and correct screenshots.
- Identified challenges in the provider mission where unclear specifications led to difficulties in evaluating submissions.
- Some users faced issues with outdated software installations or improper provider setups, requiring clarification on expectations.
Feedback for Extension:
- Proposed having more advanced goals in the pilot extension rather than repeating the same missions.
- Discussed the need for clearer instructions for missions, especially those related to providers.
- Encouraged a variety of missions to enhance the learning and experimentation experience for participants.
### Winner Reward Claim Process
- Robert shared that he received 19 private message requests related to the winners of the first phase of the Zealy pilot.
- Proposed two ways to handle winners claiming rewards: manually reviewing DMs or creating a new mission for winners to submit their addresses.
- Benjamin suggested incorporating address submission in the first mission to avoid complications later.
- Robert agreed with Benjamin's suggestion and highlighted the simplicity of modifying the existing mission for address submission.
- The group agreed on the approach of integrating address submission in the initial mission.

### New Missions Discussion
- Robert Del Rey emphasizes the need to raise the bar and introduce more challenging missions for participants.
- Benjamin proposes continuing existing missions with modifications and introduces new, more specialized ones to engage active community members.
- Benjamin's First Mission Idea: Participants create and deploy a project from scratch, moving beyond using existing deployment templates.
- Benjamin's Second Mission Idea: Create a new validator, aiming for a top 100 position or at least being active on the GitHub discussions page. Acknowledges the need for further refinement.
- Tyler Wright supports the idea of encouraging validator participation but suggests refining the timing and details of the second mission.
- Mission 3: Detailed mission on becoming a provider, including specs, GPU, and uptime requirements.
- Mission 4: Rewarding users for active participation in GitHub discussions, encouraging research posts and engagement.
- Mission 5: Creating well-edited short videos demonstrating how to deploy specific topics (e.g., React apps, Python projects) to Akash.
- Tyler suggests an "Integrations Mission" as a more open-ended challenge. Participants could figure out an integration into a storage solution, with rewards ranging from $300 to 500 AKT. It would essentially be a small hackathon.
- Tyler raises a concern about incentivizing comments on GitHub discussions, suggesting it may lead to insincere or unnecessary contributions.
- Tyler emphasizes the importance of encouraging providers to consider features like IP lease and persistent storage.

### Ideas for "Integration Mission":
- Tyler Wright supports the idea and adds to it by suggesting future missions that encourage building integrations with other projects like Filecoin, storage, and other decentralized infrastructure projects.
- Tyler envisions creating missions that simplify workflows and provide references for integrating Akash with various storage solutions, contributing to a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.
- Robert Del Rey confirms Tyler's suggestion, summarizing it as creating missions that encourage building storage solutions on Akash for projects like Filecoin, with specific rewards tied to the integration.

#### Closing Comments
#### Robert Del Rey:
- Affirms the plan to extend the pilot until January 5th.
- Highlights the urgency to finalize new missions, rewards, and communicate the extension to the community.
- Thanks the team for their contributions and participation.
- Encourages members to reach out for questions or discussions on Discord or Telegram.
## Action Items
- Group to explore the possibility of an "Integrations mission", defining criteria and potential rewards.
- Benjamin to refine and finalize the proposed mission concepts
- Robert to focus on shaping and refining the proposed missions into actionable tasks for implementation.
- Robert to explore the possibility of attaching rewards to successful friend invites, considering feasibility and tracking challenges.
- Group plan to run the extended pilot until January 5th.

Robert Del Rey: Alright guys GM and welcome to the last silly Community call working group of the year. My name is Del Rey. So happy to have join today guys And also we are recording in case people can't join right now. So I was saying before studying they call. Yeah, it seems that people was busy doing the wicked asking questions about the prices. so I guess what we're gonna discuss on the agenda today is the selection or determining the winners for the akt prices. I want to go over that and also here you guys thoughts about Gathering the winners addresses. So basically those two are the main topics. I have a mind.

Robert Del Rey: and yeah, then we can talk about extending the pilot to which is a whole other story. about Gathering the winners and the addresses thanks to Benji bendy created a script. I just needed to send him a file with all the participants on a cash, silly. and after he run this the script we were able to determine how many people participated? How many missions they did how many XP points they earn and more most importantly how many akt rewards we should send them which is super awesome tool. Thank you so much bendy. You really were the MVP just because of that tool I can tell you that. So let me open up the document.

Robert Del Rey: I have it in an Excel file in my computer. I don't know. That's another question. Maybe how can we go about publishing this? I believe I publish. One document one link already, but this one doesn't have the addresses people use to sign up and On the document I sent you have a hash. for the user you have the XP points. You have their Discord username that Twitter username and the username they have four ceiling. So the only thing that is not showing up in the link I sent on Friday. It's gonna be the addresses that people used to First login or just add any random address for City because Celio also asking for address

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, I believe that was a good privacy measure. But yeah in total, There are 20 people that earn akt prices which I believe was super nice big bigger Plus for that. Is gracing it over two weeks we had that amount of participants And also these 20 winners are after being you review the missions because if I understand right there were people that participated but the missions were in good enough to earn the points. At the end we had more people signed up to see than more people that got the rewards and that makes sense. I just believe that in just two weeks. This is a great number to have any people.

Robert Del Rey: There two that won around 45 akt each and were two people. And after that if you take an average.

Robert Del Rey: On average everybody want around 20 to 25 AC for the 20 participants. If you take the average now the highest earners 145 and the lowest earners are one just 10 akt which I believe it's also good. I don't know but if you want to go over this and maybe tell me your experience about running the tool getting the winners.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, overall, how do you feel about the prices we did? And the missions to earn those prices and maybe you can add some insights about reviewing those missions. Yeah.

Benjamin B: Yeah, So let me start with The script I created basically just goes through the leaderboard for every user. And they click the linked basically and I'm explaining the money process. So if you go to leaderboard page. You will see all the users there. If you click on user profile there you will see the missions completed. in the script, I don't have any information of the attempted measures only the ones that were reviewed and that passed. so after doing this for each and every user with the script It compiles it to a total number. And to help Robert. I also created it so that

00:05:00

Benjamin B: it showed the individual equity and for the missions, I think that some of the missions were really easy, but

Benjamin B: We got kind of what we wanted. We wanted to get users to experiment with and we did exactly that so people who never used a coach before were able to create deployments and while they didn't create something of their own they got to Try out the network and experiment. I think that for the extension we should try to have some more goals than just make them experiment. I don't think we should do the same thing.

Benjamin B: For every part of the pilot, I think we can have some more advanced ones. We could have more rewards etc for the individual Rewards.

Benjamin B: besides this I think it was only the reviewing part The reviewing of each mission was easy for me because I knew how to look for everything so for them deployments I had to open one link first and then in that link, usually there was a link that led to an active deployment. and if that active deployment was Correct. I let them pass for the screenshots. That was easy. Also, I saw some people installing very old software like the Akash CLI or whatever to say instead of provide your services. So those have to be denied but I still explained what he did wrong and what it had to do. to pass

Benjamin B: and the only one that was kind of hard was the provided one because we did not really specify. What we wanted the deliveries to be like so some providers quit instantly. and I think all providers that actually set up their provider for even a few minutes were collected by two such as the provider Explorer there, but then I saw some people They went through the freight to wrap installation, but unfortunately, I couldn't let them pass because what they wrote was the screenshot that they showed. Did not show anything detailing about the provider. So it was like

Benjamin B: the page where they set up the DNS and they did it for the main they didn't even own so. I couldn't really help them.

Robert Del Rey: That's okay, Thanks for sharing. It wasn't quite experience. I was sending a message this morning and something I was thinking about is. all the

Robert Del Rey: Learn using ceiling after we kind of started running the pilot and I'm pretty sure that over time we're gonna keep on improving the process and how clear are the missions with the instructions. Because I remember the questions on Discord. I Should this mission go on testnet to distribution go on Main should this Mission stays open for three weeks can I close it right away, right so though those little details I guess it's good that now we have them and we can use those three details to make the missions better and more clear for the future. Thank you so much Benjamin for that. I have nineteen private message request on this score

00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: and the reason why is that I'm guessing is because on Friday I sent the message that we have the winners for the first phase of the city pilot. and to claim the reward they have to send me at the end the winners have to send me a DM. I got 19 requests. So I'm going to filter now wish out of those are a scam request which are legit. After I'm done with those I will go ahead and review the winners list again and see who has sent me any message yet and try to tag them in the public chat in the seal in public hey, thanks for why you haven't sent me a message Send me your message so you can claim your Rewards.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, that's one way to do it. But there is another way I'm thinking and is That We could create a mission. It can be called.

Robert Del Rey: a cash Pilot One winners submit your address and we can create the mission in a way that people can click and submit an address and then We can review those submissions and pay out the rewards space on that. Now you might be asking how can we avoid?

Robert Del Rey: Not how can we make sure that only the winners to meet their addresses? That's a great question. I guess we can do a condition. Making that the only people that can come complete the missions are the ones that have X amount of points or have done this amount of missions. That way we can make sure that the only people that can do this missions are the one that actually won the

Robert Del Rey: the equity rewards go ahead and you

Benjamin B: I don't think there's any point in limiting which people can turn in their akt address if it's not on Sealy because we know which users and one we just don't know their address yet. I think that for next time if it's possible. We should have a mission it's the first mission that you have to do. And they have to create an ATT address and write down that address in that mission, but then once that's done, it's all to complete so they can continue. And if they mess up without it's their own fault, and of course we can try to help but then we should have their address.

Robert Del Rey: Dude, that's so a smart man. I love it. Thank you so much. I just wrote it down. So if I got it, right basically would be same that the first mission that we have get access to a silly Community. We can add another mission or another field asking them to submit their address beforehand so that way we have their address right away, right or is something we get into that, right?

Benjamin B: Yeah, I don't think we need to create another one. We could just modify the existing one, but either way works.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, I like that one better. Thank you so much. It's simpler and like you say it wouldn't make point to have them I mean to do the condition and try to filter the winners from a scammers because we already have the winners. So it's gonna be a question of matching who is writing and The user is writing us to us. So yeah, Okay, so I guess we can do that. All right, guys, do you have any questions or comments so far before I move on to the next topic I have online.

Scott Hewitson: No, sounds good to me.

Robert Del Rey: highest court assignment, thanks for jumping

Scott Hewitson: All right. Yeah. I was a little late. My daughter was a little unruly this morning, so I had to deal with that, but I'm here.

Robert Del Rey: New Good Men. Thanks for young Penny. I don't know if I heard correctly, but are you sick. Also, I'm having some weather sick. I don't know.

00:15:00

Scott Hewitson: I'm sick, every other week just because of the stuff that my daughter brings home. But now I'm okay. I'm on the mend.

Robert Del Rey: Got him, and thank you. All right.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, so up next. bangi And the rest of course. I want to expand on what other missions can we bring to the table? when you were saying in the beginning that the missions were great because there were simple enough to make people try to cash even people that haven't done a cash. Ever they did it for the first time and were able to do the missions and earn some Rewards. So now I guess the question is how can we level up that? How can we raise the bar? How can we give them people another challenge they feel challenge enough to do it, but don't feel like a skirt to give it a shot, right?

Robert Del Rey: So, yeah, I guess I'm gonna open the station now what other kind of missions could we bring to the table to keep the ball rolling I guess.

Robert Del Rey: I like to brainstorm but for now because since we're extending the pilot, I honestly don't have any idea. I try on Saturday coming up with ideas for New Missions for extending the pilot, but I couldn't come with new challenges I guess we can do the same similar missions that we had but I like to bring different missions. But when you have his hand up, let's see what he can say about that. Go ahead and

Benjamin B: So first of all, I think that we should continue with the existing once we could modify them a little bit. and use the previous budget for that if we're allowed for the extension. I also think that we should have New Missions. I want this to be more specialized. I want to be able to get the community members that are really active Or I really engaged so. The first mission that I was thinking of I would write all of this in the shot later. includes rating in a culture up From scratch so you have a project on your PC? You created documents. Upload it create L unemployed to my coach. Right now we have only made them deployed templates.

Benjamin B: then for the second mission, I'm thinking that this is a really hard Mission by the way, but

Benjamin B: but some validators are not really active. So when you're wondering if it's possible to Try to create a mission that Create a new validator and make the top 100 sets. or at least create a new validator and be active on the GitHub discussions page.

Benjamin B: This one still needs more refining because a lot of Tyler go ahead.

Tyler Wright: I'd like this idea. I think something that Scott and I are trying to do is make sure that all the validators are participating more. So I think a lot of we're meeting with a number of folks and just connecting with folks because that's relationships that previously we weren't owning and managing. So as we move into New Year, I think that's going to happen. I don't and I think that might be a mission that might be too soon for right now. I also think that the part about getting them into active sets. It's really just down to Dallas and sense. And so I'm not sure that's a mission. I really like the first couple of missions, but only thing I was going to add it. I was wondering if there's a possibility to do an Integrations mission that might be a little more open-ended and be something like worth $300 to 500 akt and it's just

Tyler Wright: basically I can small hackathon, figure out an integration into a storage solution, that other users can use or something like that. That's other people can benefit from and maybe somebody from the community might be having interest in doing over the holiday.

00:20:00

Benjamin B: They can try to continue on this topic and…

Robert Del Rey: awesome

Benjamin B: right now and if you're aware of what the Sierra Network is. Or if you're not it's a storage Network where you can From different so you rent from maybe 30 or more hosts. And if your data gets lost you can replicate it and always have this a great redundancy. Anyways right now they have a hackathon in their Discord Channel. Let me Called the render the hacker phone and basically what this is about is. renting storage from the network and I think that integration with a car share with the very possible so they could earn both a hackathon if they win and they could also earn something from the Sealy mission if they create something.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I think this is until the end of the month. I don't see it.

Tyler Wright: I think that's a great idea.

Robert Del Rey: That's cool. Yeah, so next time idea.

Tyler Wright: I think just speaking out loud and this is very much off the Record while we're on the record. So anybody listens to this later don't hold me to this, but in terms of Partners like file coin, stored storage a storage. However, they're pronounce SEO RJ currently the team.

Tyler Wright: Uses our weave for saving videos in the cloud perpetually, so I think figuring out ways to build Integrations with these kinds of projects and see being another one other web free projects. I really love the idea of building on the back of a hackathon that's already happening, but any of those kinds of projects building in Integrations and workflows that use a cash and those Storage Solutions I think those be great addition to the network and things I know that people are asking for.

Benjamin B: Yeah, so let's write this down. I'll save all the properties.

Robert Del Rey: I wrote some then already. Thank you so much Tyler, and just to confirm I got it right Do you mean creating missions that encourage building Integrations with other projects like file coin they have? Another storage solution you suggesting that we do hey build this storage Solution on a cache for file coin for 500 akt and put that as a mission on Siri, right?

Tyler Wright: Yeah, it's like a whole bunch of people that I know are trying to be decentralized as a principle right and to try to figure out workflows and wish they could use things like a cops and other decentralized infrastructure right now. It's very fragmented. So everybody is doing their own thing and building their own one solution. It would be great. Even if those one-on-one solution continue to exist if there was a simpler way. That maybe could be reference and…

Robert Del Rey: 

Tyler Wright: documentation or elsewhere. It's like If you're trying to do this kind of workflow just use a cache and X storage solution, and putting these commands and do this thing, and it'll just be easy, and I think that's what we're trying to do make the user experience easier for folks. I'm an integrate with other projects where we can

Robert Del Rey: Really? The species open today, I guess. So if you're gonna say something guys use young green.

Benjamin B: All So from what's Scott said here? I actually think that makes a lot of sense to create some of these workflows to be boundless instead of and rewarding them for silly. What we could do is that we create a mission on silly but we don't write the rewards there. We say that you can get involved with the bounties and you can get involved with this hackathon. but We're not gonna waste any of the budget from the ceiling what do you think about that guys

Robert Del Rey: Yeah. Absolutely.

Scott Hewitson: Yeah, it's like a call to action to earn more or try more.

00:25:00

Tyler Wright: Yeah, that makes sense to me.

Scott Hewitson: yeah, I think I mean,…

Benjamin B: Let's continue that often.

Scott Hewitson: I know everyone's got a bunch of great ideas, not shooting any down, but I think if we stay within the scope of zilly zealy for now, I like all those ideas like we've got the Bounty funds and something that I'm trying to I want to happen more in 2024 is as cigs and working groups. they have ideas. It's like this would be cool and it's a small effort. It's like let's throw it up as a bounty. So I want people like the groups to be coming up with Bounty ideas and stuff. So it's all good stuff in my mind.

Benjamin B: Let me jump back into what I was talking about earlier. I was talking about some of the missions. I was thinking of and the third mission is that I think that we could have more detailed mission on what it means to be a provider so we could have a mission for creating a provider. Maybe we should have specs as a requirement Maybe. a GPU and not only the specs but of course, let's Force some uptime as well. We didn't do this last time and we had to reward someone who had it up for probably a few minutes.

Benjamin B: the fourth mission is kind of similar to what I was. I started mission to the validator one including this one already and I was thinking that maybe we should reward users and the guide them to the GitHub discussions. I think the more people were getting involved there and if they were to create research posts on GitHub discussions or getting engaged in a lot of discussions I think that we should be able to reward that as a mission. The last one that I was thinking of is creating a well edited short videos that shows either how to deploy a specific topics maybe react apps or python products to a coach. or

Benjamin B: showing how to just deploy dockering much in the course. I think that if you were to Get a short video out that's well edited and shows how to use a coach the full process in a minute or two. I think this would be really valuable and if we're lucky a lot of people could see that. And that could be some great marketing. and so for my ideas

Robert Del Rey: appreciation brother

Robert Del Rey: you cannot cover a lot of different missions that we can start playing with. This is good stuff, man. Thank you so much.

Tyler Wright: Yes, I love all those ideas and they're very specific and really meant Focus. the GitHub discussions idea while I like my only hesitation is now we're just incentivizing people to just leave comments where maybe they wouldn't be inclined to have such a strong opinion before and now we're just for the sake of money to just putting something up there. That's my only hesitation with incentivizing comments. All the other ideas. I think are great. The only thing that I would add is for the provider side if we can get Folks at least think about IP least it's a person's storage. I know that those are underutilized features on the network for providers set up. So I just want to add that but I think those ideas are great. I love the video ideas as well.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, me too. I also like that providers Mission specifically we focus more on having developers and builds done in this pilot, but I guess we can expand and have providers missions. Like they say provide this amount of resources or stay up for this amount of days. I guess those will be good missions, too.

Robert Del Rey: and I believe Tyler we agree on the GitHub discussions participations. I guess it's good to have those missions in case people want some extra XP points, but we shouldn't attach akt rewards to those kind of missions and it's the same for retweeting Missions following inviting friends those missions. I mean, it's nice you can do them, right but they shouldn't pay you akt because then as soon as we run out of we progress stop doing those things.

00:30:00

Robert Del Rey: Go ahead and you?

Benjamin B: first of all, I want to say that I agree with what Tyler says I think that comments could be created even though they don't have an opinion. I think that posts could still make sense. But even then people could just try to find something very minor that doesn't really affect anything.'re so some pros and cons to this one. We could also have it be attached to the

Benjamin B: support issues But I'm not quite sure. For what you said there at the end Robert. I think that it could actually make sense to have those invites payout Equity. not only if their friend were to actually complete submission. I'm not sure if this can be tracked but if you can invite people and get akt it works until it doesn't kind of like yourself, but it's also a great way to get more people involved. Now. We have 20 people if I remember correctly.

Benjamin B: if those 20 people were to get another 10 people. That would be a great difference.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, I love to work on this week. Thank you for dropping those ideas guys. I guess I have enough material now to expand and reassure again. not think of some I already have the mission's ideas, I will just shape them up in a way that you can see them as missions on ceiling and then we'll send that and go from there. But yeah, I will focus on three areas.

Robert Del Rey: In not any particular order, but just three areas for the new nations. I want to focus on network Integrations and tools missions like Tyler was saying if we can make people build Solutions on a cash that they other people can use that's great for the network validators And providers missions. Go ahead Tyler. So your head?

Tyler Wright: so, yeah, the only thing that I'll add is I think can you hear me?

Robert Del Rey: Yes. Yes sir.

Tyler Wright: okay, I was just gonna say I think both Benjamin and…

Robert Del Rey: Goodies are clear.

Tyler Wright: Huey said that my idea about Integrations with stupid for zealy and it's better use for the bounties and they said that I should stop talking and I'm an idiot and I think that we need to focus our time on the Provider missions as well as the video and something the ideas that Benjamin so you don't have as much. To do that again. I think they said that it was an idea. They're trying to this pity me and say all right. This is a decent idea, but we'll have to use that for Bounty. So just we can focus on the provided Missions at Benjamin outlined and then yes and also the videos of how to deploy or dockerize something.

Robert Del Rey: Okay. Thanks that thanks for that.

Scott Hewitson: It's Tyler. You matter don't let any of us tell you you don't you matter. Okay?

Scott Hewitson: And we love your ideas.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you so much guys, I'm pretty sure that maybe we heard the same words, but we understand something different. I didn't get but they were saying that your ideas were stupid tighter, but thank you for saying that.

Robert Del Rey: No, It's fine. Let me rewrite that again then. and the content creation missions like creating short videos about I guess the I guess Benjamin. I'm going to send you some messages in the DM so I can have more specifics and we can make those missions and we're gonna share those missions in the cash silly so guys can see them and maybe have people to start doing those missions right away. Let's see how we go. But yeah, I might keep you posted throughout the day. I guess a good way to start off the week. Like I said, I got 19 messages requests on Discord. I will go ahead and verify those filtered those.

00:35:00

Robert Del Rey: Take the scammers out and keep the legit ones and then go from there. And guys any other common you want to bring up before we're up?

Robert Del Rey: Okay, I'll see s Okay, those thumbs down. It's because you don't want to end the call now or because you'll have something else to say.

Scott Hewitson: I don't have anything to say to add.

Robert Del Rey: That Just You're scared. Thank you again so much for joining. This is the last see me working group called all the year. We started I later over a month ago, and we have these from just a concept in our minds to an actual thing on silly page, but I can tell you there's still a lot to learn a lot to do. but I'm pretty we're going to find a way to make this beneficial not only to a cash but also the people that participate in the missions because many said this and for what would you say baby? This was the biggest part for me was getting people that never tried a cash before getting people.

Robert Del Rey: Tried on cash for the first time and on top of that air needs to make a tea and I guess that sets them up for a good initial experience when I cash or a good beginning in the cash Community because this people might just join randomly to this silly initiative, but maybe in the course of three four months six months we can have one hell of a contributor that came randomly because of these campaign and they just gonna drop that thought I literacy your hand up Go ahead. What's up?

Tyler Wright: Yeah, just real quick. again much appreciates Robert your leadership and it's also Benjamin your leadership. I know that as next steps you guys are gonna be talking via direct message to finalize some of the next missions after that. I'm guessing you'll agree on with those missions are post them and then start sharing messages to let people know that over the next couple of weeks. There's around two and based upon the success of the pilot version one going to be extended and then extended I guess through that first week of January, is that the idea and you're all said, have it run until January 5th or something where that we couldn't transform.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, I want to have this ready ASAP…

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Robert Del Rey: because yeah,…

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Robert Del Rey: the plan the planets have it running on to January the 5th. So right now I'm more like pressure to coming up with a few.

Tyler Wright: Perfect.

Robert Del Rey: Maybe two more missions, Finalizing these rewards pain the required stuff with initial winners. and having that announcement out as soon as possible hey guys, you can still continue doing some missions and earning some extra akt So that is like the order.

Tyler Wright: amazing

Robert Del Rey: Awesome guys anything else before we run this up for the day?

Robert Del Rey: All right. Is not guys remember…

Scott Hewitson: Think we're good.

Robert Del Rey: if you have Thanks Ben you thank you all for joining. Thank you for listening the recording also in case you have any other questions thoughts courses are requests feedbacks drop by the cash working group City channel on Discord. You can also send me at the end on this score if you have me on telegram And without being said when I see you guys stay safe for the holidays. Enjoy the time with the family, whatever you're gonna do enjoy it and let's reflect on this year and come stronger for the next year in case we don't talk again. I just letting you know These Guys these are my wishes for you for next year. Okay.

Tyler Wright: Amen, happy holidays. Yes.

00:40:00

Benjamin B: Thank you very much, Robert and everyone. ability

Robert Del Rey: Happy holidays everybody.
