Robert Del Rey: All right, and welcome everybody. The Cash City Working Group call today Monday, August the 26th. briefly ago, I sent a message in the group. This is the last week of the first grade of these campaign, We've seen lots of summations so I would say roughly. We had I don't know. More than 2530 submissions. I used to give you a rough.

Robert Del Rey: We're very happy about that. keep it up, guys. This is the last week. If you haven't submitted A Build your planning to submit one. this is the last week to do, so, if you don't submit your bill now, That's fine. Some missions are going to roll over to the next sprint. So, If you don't get the points now, you're still good. Will have a chance to get the points in the springs. Number two, or the sprint number three, So yeah. Some things we did this last week, we reviewed some missions.

Robert Del Rey: Some of the content creation missions. The submissions have been very solid so far. And we are reaching out back to some of the people to give them some feedbacks and make the submissions better. We're starting to have you, we're super happy that you're getting involved. the next part of the plan is making things. That are gonna be valuable for the wider. We want people outside of this to look at This submissions. And feel like Hey I cash definitely has something going on. Let me check it out. That is the kind of feel. We want to give the people about this campaign in the solutions that we We open up a new document, which is gonna help us Maybe.

Robert Del Rey: Keep I mean, also missions are going to be reviewed. If there are low quality, they're going to be redacted, if they meet the standard, they're gonna be a success, But of the best missions. We're going to compile them into a single document and we're gonna share that with a community. Once the company is over or maybe sooner. Let's see. One thing about that is that when the screen is over, we're gonna do the math, we're gonna see how much AKP you got. The winners will be announced and

Robert Del Rey: in one or two weeks after the spring ends, those rewards should be paid out. At the same time, the sprint, number two is going to start right away. This is strength and this Friday on the 30th or Saturday, I'm not sure now. But this three. Number two, should I start on The second So on Monday, we're going to have to screen number two. and also the City Working Group, but yeah, I'm a stop real quick. I know I said a lot. yeah, that's it about the screen. Number two and the submissions dynamics. I will stop really quick. In case anybody has a question. I will give you time.

Robert Del Rey: if there are no questions, totally fine, if we do, send it in the shaft or later when you think about it in the Akash physical group, Hey, yes, I see you. So going back guys. Yeah. one thing we're gonna do in this train number one, which we didn't in the last campaign, we're going to release one month report and in that report, We're gonna add information about how many members are participating in the spring. How many new members join the cash community? How many builds we had? And also, we're going to highlight of the best fields. let me tell you if your build is selected as the best if we see the quality is

Robert Del Rey: on a whole new level level right and you make it to one of those lessons, the best submissions, I don't know, maybe it's some extra prices. I don't know if I'm saying too much money but yeah, it pays you to do the best work you can do. So let's do the best word that we can guys. Also if you feel like there is something we can improve Again, My DMs are open, feel free to reach out. So yeah, that one month report is gonna contain all that information, hopefully have that information.


### 00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: Will give. An idea to the people of the future seeing these campaign and they can look back and see the things we did. And what it's gonna Remained through the history, So yeah, there's going to be the one month report by the end of the three months, we're gonna have a three month campaign report, but every single month, we're gonna let you know all the numbers about this campaign. Yeah. that.

Robert Del Rey: Any. Race. it's again. Okay, DMV here, guys. Thank you for joining me. I wouldn't say it's quite big today. Appreciate that.

Robert Del Rey: Mmm, so yeah, so far we got paid in new members. Joining this print. And 45 participants in total. So in the current stream, there are 45 people participating. Out of those 30 people. Community? Which I believe in something to celebrate. It's just the first month, right? So yeah. I'm very stuck about that. Some updates about the last week. We heard the

Robert Del Rey: in order to do some of the missions, you needed to pay in a cash. So of course because we want them to be on the So if your submission is on mainland you will have to pay some provider for your deployment, So we decided to Create a Trusted Community RPC Nodes for a cash. So, we increase the price for that. Instead of 1580, it's gonna be 20 Akt. if I'm not mistaken, so those five X-ray KT. Should help you out with those deployment costs. Wirelessly with some.

Robert Del Rey: 80 prices, right? So yeah. That's one update about that.

Robert Del Rey: However, we reduced the amount of people that can claim the required. So in the past I believe it was 25 people. I don't remember.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, it was 50 people and we reduced the number 25. So only 25 people will be able to play this throughout the campaign at the moment. I believe we have seven submissions about these nation. So you guys will get increased rewards. And get throughout the campaign. Only 25 people will be able to create this mission. So, All Work 10 minutes in this call. Let me say the secret word for the Sealy Working Group mission. Just to give you a little context because I'm seeing new faces in this call and also for the people listening to the recording. We have missions about joining the cash, especially in this groups, and their cash working groups calls.

Robert Del Rey: So, when you join those calls, I will say out loud a secret word. And you just need to go to a cash Seeley. Find the mission about the call that you were and submit the secret word. So, for the silly mission, the secret word is gonna be the same. It's a The cloud, the E C L O u D. Right? I believe I got it right. I will send it in the chat anyway so you guys can see Obviously, you're listening to this now. If you listen to the recording, you can submit the world. When you listen to the record in this missions, will remain open throughout the screen. But you can only claim it once. That's the cash, if you claim it now.

Robert Del Rey: You cannot claim it again. I believe that's so For this week, we're gonna have the steering commit In the sitting comedy call that is going to be a secret word for you to submit and get some extra aka.


### 00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: Yeah. that.

Robert Del Rey: yeah. Does anybody has a question something you want to bring to the table? I will be a good audition. If not. Again, that's totally fine. The group is certainly open. I'm actually very happy when I just enter a cash discord. I go to the city working group and almost 100% of the time. There is any message waiting to be. so, I'm loving the engagement so far in this campaign, I remind you guys. There is a mission about referring people to attach a ceiling. If you refer to friends and those three friends complete at least one mission each, you will get some extra points and some extra So that's something good to know about.

Robert Del Rey: For this week. I'm done. Yes. So I'm done with this call. So for this week what I will do, I will work in the one month report. I will set up the screen. Number two, we will maybe and I will determine the rewards amount. And pay out those after we review all of the missions. Again, the screen is going to end. On the daily this week. It's Friday. so, if you make your submissions, After the spring ends. Those points are not going to count for the security number one, so if you want to make as much points as you can, in one screen, purchase you make everything in this spring. New missions will open up in the springs. Number two, so a sales level

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, this Friday and events. Let me see. Yeah, August earlier. So at that time, the sprint number one, it's gonna have. And the spring, number two starts on Monday, the second. so yeah, Benjamin Sorry, for which on the spot. But is there anything you want to add about the missions or that review? You have done so far. Then this guy actually reviewing the technical missions. So if you guys have a questions Technicals about a cache, then it's the guy to help you out. So I will give it to you but they don't know if you want to add anything.

Robert Del Rey: It's good to hear, man.

Robert Del Rey: if you see something that stands out, Remember to put in the content solution. Document. And we should a document with you guys when we have a complete ready, right?

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, that. Thank you so much money. I didn't say the day of the Call the city in community college, it's gonna happen this Thursday, the 29. I guess so, if you join and you listen to the secret word, you'll be able to get some extra XP points, the more XP, the more I think you get and I believe this color is gonna be short today, baby, don't you say unless anybody has something to add I guess we can just end it here. You guys have any questions or anything you want to stop in a mission or something?

Robert Del Rey: That's fine.

Robert Del Rey: All right, that I just will say this before we go. Okay, I have a question here. My guy Quentin.

Robert Del Rey: 7200. Do we need to code an RBC note from a scratch? Or deploying, you're a fast reader. go ahead, and if you are gonna reply,


### 00:15:00

Benjamin B: yeah, I just wanted to say that this mission we had some feedback on this on how we best, could make sure the people actually created for the long term.

Benjamin B: Chance of your question. Just deploying it. It's enough. I'm running it. You don't have to code anything, you just have to get it running. But because of the mission of wanting to create some long-term RPC servers. And I think this one, we should wait until the end of the campaign to pay out because then we can track that. the RPCODE has actually been active for longer than just maybe. Until it's reviewed.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you Hope the answers your question and thank you baby. For the support.

Robert Del Rey: All right.

Robert Del Rey: It's Monday, We're gonna make it happen. If we survive them, Monday, we're gonna survive the week and told you that. And so yeah. I'm gonna leave it here again. Thank you for your question. Thanks Benji About the missions reviewing. And guys. Remember to join the steering community. Call. For more chances to earn expert tokens, the screen. Number one ends this week so make it happen. If you have questions, go to the Cash CV, Working Group chat in a cash discord. And yeah, I said another question, maybe could it be precise on the missions for the people?

Robert Del Rey: Yeah yes sure Nice catch up. Let's go ahead and add that to the mission bendy so it can be more clear for more participants. This is the work in progress, right? we're gonna get better as we go but we cannot definitely get better without you guys. Not helping. And stepping in, this is the first innovation I guess. This is something that we want to do long-term. And our cities in the future is that this is gonna be a channel where we can introduce a cash all kinds of people. So they're better. We do this. Now, the parent is gonna be the future when more and more people can access to these

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, it's a little inspiration for you and this week. So yeah, guys again, thank you for doing anything. The recording and the notes will be available in Github shortly.
