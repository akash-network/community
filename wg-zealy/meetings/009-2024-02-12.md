Robert Del Rey: Okay, and here we go your life. Thank you so much for that. So guys happy Monday. Welcome again to the city to the cash Sealy working group session. For these developer onboarding initiative, which is getting better and better by the day. today's agenda. It's short but powerful. Last week I was speaking with Benji. We went over the missions. We want to offer in these campaign. So today's again. It's basically about sharing with Those who are here now and those who listen the recording share with the missions were coming up. And maybe you can drop some feedbacks or initial box.

Robert Del Rey: We're going to go on a high level through each Mission just Also, the second topic we get for this call is preparing the proposal to finally go on shame now. It's another big one. Which I'm super excited about and we're gonna share more details as this call progresses. So You can share your extreme. I don't know if you can share only the list of missions that is sent to you.

Benjamin B: Wait, let me get that.

Robert Del Rey: Sure, no rushman.

Benjamin B: So the full message that from Rocky days ago

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, yeah. That one for Friday, I believe the one that shows all the missions in this. Go ahead Tyler.

Benjamin B: I just copied it here. And they should be able to see no.

Robert Del Rey: yes. I'll see Thank you so much Tyler. I see your hand up.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, just real quick. I did want to shout you all out real fast. So.

Tyler Wright: Last week as a cost prepares for East Denver. There were a couple of bounties that went up online. There will be some more bounties that go up online for building sdls the way to specific East projects. One of those sdls was built in that Bounty was filled by somebody that came through the zealy program. They've been a contributor to the ecosystem and so they've received that down to so it's just great to see them come through zealy have success there and then stay in the community stay active respond to a bounty and they said that if we put more of those kind of down tease on zealy, they know other people would come it was just like building an sdl for a layer to eat a project, but I just want to shout out the workflow and obviously the work that you all done to bring that person into the Chica system. So just wanted to

Tyler Wright: thank you all aware of that. I'll drop in this specific item here.

Robert Del Rey: Wow, thank you so much Tyler. It was an aware of that.

Benjamin B: Thank you for mentioning this.

Robert Del Rey: Great news, that's great stuff, honestly.

Robert Del Rey: Really really cool. I wrote down the Akash bounties. Maybe we can come up with some missions base of the cash bounties all over what you were saying, but that's amazing. So the person came from CB he saw their cash boundary. He did the Bounty and he turned the Bounty. That's really amazing. It's really amazing. Thank you again. let's do this. I will go ahead and read you the mission titles for this call for the recording. And after physical, I will go ahead and go over the counties and chat with Benjamin C. What can we bring to see because yeah, I cash is known to have these bounties for everybody, but maybe

Robert Del Rey: Not everybody can find these polities. So maybe having them on Sealy will help everybody to get more bountystone, which it's gonna be amazing. You may just one second guys before I get start.

00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: All right guys, okay, so I guess I'm writing now. So let's see on the screen. First of all the missions we're gonna go. For three months and we're gonna come up with a series of missions depending on the month. So first, we're going to see the missions for month one again. I was just really the Mission Title so it can be in the recording then if you have any special comment or feedback or question three feet less like question. So here I go the first mission. We got the category build on a cache missions. And we have here create a basic web app in Python and deployed on a cache. This is the first example that we did a while ago. This mission is dividing three.

Robert Del Rey: So in the first mission people will download what they need in the second mission. They will create the environment more stuff that they need and on the last mission. They're gonna test the app and run the app. So when they do that, they're gonna submit that and after reviewing. They might get their Rewards.

Robert Del Rey: so before move to the next one since this mission is divided in three. You will see. That mission one and two doesn't give you any XP or doesn't give you any akt, but the last mission of the series will give you the XP and we'll also tell you how much 80 you will earn. After you do the mission and it's not that people will do the mission and they will claim the reward right away on Mission 3 there. They are gonna submit their build and after we review the bill then we're gonna decide They earned the reward based on the quality of the job.

Robert Del Rey: Things that we added in these new campaign are more instructions. It's more clear now if they do copied work if they do low quality work. We want to set those Solutions. so well moving on to the next one. It's create an AI power at Cash Wiki to find all the information in the patient about a cash. This one is not ready on Steely yet, but it's just a mission idea. We believe it's really fun. And if one person can come up with that, it's gonna be really neat, honestly. I repeat the title again create an AI power a cache Wiki to find all the info and documentation about a cash imagine something like I don't know. How do I spin up a validator? You can write that and you can get information you're looking for that will be really nice if someone can do that.

Robert Del Rey: Go ahead then. Yes. See your hand, man.

Benjamin B: I believe there are at least two projects that have done some sort of AI air Chef Pops that have the knowledge of the Akash documentation. And basically does this but besides this I think it's a very large scope for Mission. I'm not sure if we were to like it.

Robert Del Rey: guidance

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, it could be too big Maybe. Let's see. I don't know. to the next mission then I create AI power a cache images using sdlx disconnects different. This missions are not on the build on a crash category. They are on the Akash content mission. And something we wanted to do in this next phase is bring more kinds of missions. So more people can get involved. in this missions It's not that everybody's gonna win. It's not that you're gonna create the image. You're gonna submit that and you're gonna win.

Robert Del Rey: We are going to review those missions. And we're gonna have a minimum of Three to five winners. That is what Benjamin I spoke about last week. now after we're done with this face and we still got budget to have two more winners. We can consider and do that depending on the submissions. But at the moment these create a cash content missions, we plan to have from three to five winners at the moment.

00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: yeah, what are we seeing in the screen Sorry Ben that wasn't watching the phone.

Benjamin B: Yeah, Tyler said something in the shot and I felt like I had to try it out while you were talking about the missions.

Benjamin B: So from the looks of it, it's a shot where you can get instructions on how to do things on a college if you ask the correct questions, and I'm trying to see how good this will be Taylor has something more to advise. I see that's your handless race.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Yes, I just meant to drop that in the chat. That's something that a team is building. There'll eat them for as well. But to your discussion about chat. I know that they can be very involved. I know that piercing the team that worked on the website revamp hotel for work on the chatbot. So, I don't know if necessary that should be a mission to Benjamin's point, but I just want to share this one. I follow up and share what some people are building and people can test already.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, That's pretty nice. I really wasn't worth this. Excuse me.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, let's move on there.

Robert Del Rey: So in the Creator cache in their cash content missions as I was saying we're trying to get the best content we can. And also things that people have asked in the channels for example this one. It's create short style my cash videos. This one I got it from the telegram chat. Someone actually dropped that suggestion a few months ago. we should have people creating shorts a style videos about what is a cash. What can you do on a cash and I believe to get started the first one it's gonna be A shortest style. What is a cash video make I don't know. But if you can go to the Sealy now and show this Mission so people can see in the recording how they look like.

Robert Del Rey: There you go. The second one. Exactly. So you see this one XP has akt price. It's not that all the people that participate are gonna win. as I was saying we have

Robert Del Rey: as I was saying we have avoided for five winners if they have really really good Solutions if there are less submissions than that, we do less prices. Now if we get big amount of submissions we can consider where we do about that. So as you can see the videos emission you have some requirements just to make sure this is valid about it's a mission. You have that the video has to be shared in a social media platform has to be public. You have to share the link to the video. You see below also be creative low quality work or copy work will not be accepted. It is qualified right away. So, let's see how that goes.

Robert Del Rey: But yeah, this create a cache videos. This one is for the first month. We got some more create content missions. We're gonna go over them in the next month, which is gonna happen shortly now. The last mission I want to share with you about the month one. It's gonna provide GPU to a cash Network. And we need help in this. It's not that we need help. But we got the questions. So we're gonna drop the question here in case somebody wants to shine in but we also want to drop the question in the providers chat. In the question was a moment.

Robert Del Rey: I was confused. we a question was about deploying persistent storage. We're gonna go to that one in a second. So going back to the provide GPU to a cash Network that mission. Yeah, let's see if we can you guys have a cache are trying to bring more providers to the network. You are incentivizing provide There is a proposal. I believe in class already or providers incentives. So I feel one good mission was

00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: trying to bring providers to provide debut to a cash Network and we got some requirements 99% of time and other requirements and maybe if they jump into this score, sorry if they jump into silly and they do this Mission as a provider. They can turn off you extra more AKP at the moment. I don't have the price number. maybe when did you can go to Sealy and open up? Mission to see how much it was the price. I haven't added it yet. as you can see you will find that the missions in the rewards section. They're gonna show XP and they're gonna show akt so it's a working progress. So this one should show the XP and should show the

Robert Del Rey: AKP I don't know how many akt we should give out for this but you can see Let me know if maybe we are missing some other requirements to make this Mission successful.

Robert Del Rey: I've become a provider on the Akash Network. You have to score a minimum of 95% of time for one full month. There is a guy on how to become a provider which we have to attach here in the description. But yeah, that's about it. Maybe you can have some box. You can drop them now or maybe you Benjamin not seen the participants screen now.

Tyler Wright: But I think Benjamin has his hand up. Go ahead Benjamin.

Benjamin B: yeah, I wanted to say I'm not sure What's the progress is on this proposal but there is something related to incentivizing GPU providers already, so I'm not quite sure if we should do this missions like this Mission the only being related to the provider or if we should do it for the GPU because if we

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Tyler Wright: Hundred h100 some of the higher-end perfect. You see on the screen RTX a6000 and basically these are commitments that overclock Labs team and other folks from the community are managing where we're looking to bring on Commit. It's a committed pool So for data centers that are usually tier three getting them to come on for a month and giving them a bunch of incentives is not good enough because it takes them a while to get online. they have additional metrics for how they do business go for these folks. We started off with a one-year commitment. and so this is for a data centers that have again multiple gpus I think from a zealy challenge perspective if anybody has Forty nineties or up?

Tyler Wright: Or even a 40s that are on that they want to bring on to the network and quantities less than 10, small quantities that I think we could take some funds to incentivize those folks because that they're the first part of this committed pool is it's again for large larger quantities of gpus go ahead Benjamin.

Benjamin B: Are you referring to using the Bounty proof for that or already referring to using the rewards pool? Because for what you're saying it still makes sense to have this Mission regardless if we have a GPU or if you only have the provider aspect of it.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, So what I'm saying is I think we should keep this Mission because the current incentive pool is geared more towards data center right now and I feel like this zealy audience is going to be more smaller providers. And so the incentives on zealy would still apply to them where they wouldn't apply necessarily for this first stage phase one of this. incentives program

00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: It's similar to…

Benjamin B: heroids

Robert Del Rey: what they were saying bendy not make it we're looking for dpu providers, but make it more General. So everybody can try it out and become a provided on my cash, but they don't necessarily have the heavy equipment like you were saying Tyler which is what this proposal is aiming for bigger heavy players, right

Benjamin B: Yeah, I…

Tyler Wright: Yes, exactly.

Benjamin B: It after you explained everything Tyler.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, yeah.

Benjamin B: I think it makes perfect sense to keep it as is.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, Thank you for your input. So while moving on then let's go to month. Number two. Again, thank you for the feedback guys. And for month number two here. We have the deploya persistent storage solution that Nation we don't have it on seal yet. It's just the tire idea. But I believe this one is similar to becoming a provider on a cache we want different people to try different aspects of a cache and I believe if we have people deploying persistent storage solution. It's gonna be good. Even if it's just on a smaller scale or just like a general.

Robert Del Rey: Storage solution. So yeah, these is the one that I was mentioning earlier. I really don't have any idea how to put it on a mission. I will just go to the providers group and write something like how would you add this to see me? How would you make these a mission? I don't know how to go about this one. It's all I'm trying to say but basically the mission is that have people deploying a persistent storage solution. Maybe they can have that running for one month. and yeah, that's basically the mission. You have any thoughts of questions about it now, it's the best time to discuss it.

Robert Del Rey: If not, that's okay again, I will drop that question in the chat on Discord to see what those guys have to say. But I believe it would be like a fun mission to have and this is for month to so it

Tyler Wright: Sorry Robert. Is this Mission specifically for a deployer that needs to use persistent storage or a provider that's going to provide consistent storage

Robert Del Rey: That's a great question, I mean if it's gonna be for the Providing the persistence storage solution not someone using the storage solution. Does that make sense that?

Tyler Wright: Yes. I think from that perspective. You could just say provide persistent storage on the network for one month in a provider It could be a CPU provider and I believe that we'll be able to use either. Some sort of auditing mechanism, even if it's manual to make sure that they're running persistent storage over that month. I don't know if you have to get anything else from the providers we can just be like, all right, are they running persistent storage be when they provider gets brought on WE audited it manually if it has persistent storage cool, then they're past phase one. We can check it at the five day Mark to 10 day Mark, and eventually when Benjamin and his brother and their team are done they have automated tool right now. We might just have to do it manually. But yeah, I think that's how we can move forward. Go ahead.

Benjamin B: I think no one tries to abuse it I think we don't even have to verify it because I believe there goes a lot into trying to fake it more than just actually having it. So if a provider has it you can easily where that data.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, exactly. I will say and…

Robert Del Rey: awesome

Tyler Wright: I'll just put this on the record just from multiple test Nets and multiple other endeavors. You'll be surprised what people try to do, and the lengths I'll go the fake is sometimes I just like it would have been easier to probably do the work successfully, but I digress

Robert Del Rey: I can't imagine man, honestly.

Benjamin B: Yeah, if someone can fake it, I think we should give the rewards.

Robert Del Rey: All Thanks for the input And I changed the word in a bit instead of It's provide persistent storage solution for one month. Thanks guys, the other mission on build on a cash this one we got it from the previous hackathon. I believe nobody please this one and that's why I wanted to bring it up on Sealy. It might be too broad. Thank you said in the other Mission. here we goes. It's about creating Frameworks for automated skating and low balancing. I can tell you the name, but honestly, I don't know what looks like. But it was a track in the hackathon. Maybe I could speak with Adam. Maybe he didn't tell me.

00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: The idea he had on mine when he came up with this truck. But yeah, that's the mission again. Yeah, the missions might be like two brother to be but honestly when I had a mind is like We already did the pilot. We got some simple Nations to do people did the missions. I guess we should go ahead and go level two or level three and making missions more challenging harder for them. s Another thing is that we want people to do the missions, so I don't know. What would be like the meat point in that. Maybe you got the answer being. Yes. your hand up man. Come on in.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I wanted to speak on the creating Frameworks for automated scaling and the load balancing. and I might even have been a part of creating that track but afterwards I didn't really like it because to create a good solution for this It's quite a large task to create something that works for your personal uses. It doesn't have to be super large but A lot goes into especially the balancing part of it. So how do you want to keep it load balanced? How do you want to make sure that everything is running apps by default don't have something to show for that the automated scaling

Benjamin B: and if a provider were to go down. Sure you can probably create some sort of General solution. But if you for example host validator and then this part goes wrong and you create a new instance your provider would get if you didn't do it correctly. There please. Go ahead.

Tyler Wright: Sorry I didn't want to cut you off as you're talking. I guess the best way I could describe is hold in the experience for people that are trying to find things like Alternatives AWS. I believe that should be a mission. if we can have missions that are all right, if somebody's used to a load balance or another tool, but it's very kind of primitive on Akash can we have somebody a build a proof of concept or build an integration that uses some tooling? that could be phase one of a load balancer that folks can use on Akash that's easier to use or easier to integrate.

Tyler Wright: If we can have some of those stretch missions that maybe you're not even a solution but a proof of concept, then we can get people into the ecosystem that we're like, this is a cool team that's building something and then they could find other ways to incentivize whether it be like the community pool or sick and working groups or many Grant, so again, Benjamin was talking about having user experience, flaws and in the current class product, it'd be great. If you can think about some of those things Benjamin and Robert as mission to try to entice people into the ecosystem.

Benjamin B: This part that were proof of concepts are allowed. I think that's perfect because Solutions don't have to be perfect even in hackathons. It doesn't have to be production already for it to win prices most of the time. I was thinking yeah, and we want everything to be good. But the proof of Concepts idea is great.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, honestly, and you still and just to get people into a cash and get people to try out I guess and get people to real on a cash. so yeah, let's Let's see how that goes. Thanks better moving on the missions for months, too. We got the content missions for this month. Are a bit different you more one is about creating a post about their cash merger store. we spoke a little about that one and bendy. What did we say on Friday about this one should be only for the Insiders to do it. I don't remember where we got into. with this mission the posting about the cash commercial store. You can refresh my mind a little.

00:30:00

Benjamin B: Yeah. Yeah, I talked about this one a little because

Benjamin B: I think this one. Most people don't really have a coach merch that Tyler just went away.

Robert Del Rey: Mm-hmm

Benjamin B: He said the right back and the left. So if we're talking now,…

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Benjamin B: we're just going to say the same things as we did. but anyways The idea here is that some insiders cut a coach merch for free some insiders attending IRL events and get merged for free but normally users in the community. Don't get it. Some people were against if insiders were a big portion of the ones claiming rewards because they're already involved. And we want to onboard new users. So I'm not quite sure how we should feel about this one.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, Yeah, I remember now. Thanks for the contents. and you're right, I mean if people see that five six insiders are winning prices, they're gonna Think something's up. But it's okay. I guess how we should go about this mission. first we should make it a contest so the best of all wins the one with more likes it with wings. Yes. Maybe they can have a pot that use that for them. But you got people in the competition.

Robert Del Rey: I don't know it can get complicated honestly. Yes, we want people to use their cash commercial store. Yes, we're gonna have new designs. how I was ambition in this mission was something like getting people to post on social media rather than having them buying things from the merch store. So maybe we can think a bit more about this mission. But normal community members participate. I don't care if we give them the teacher for free. Of course. We want them to buy the T-shirt, but I don't care. They go with this mission in particular is about having people posting about a cash merge on social media, that can be powerful.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, yeah, even if there's five to ten people participate. if then five get three retweets each that's 15. Accounts reach if you know what I mean.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, that's more people that can see more about a cashmere and see more about a cash. But yeah, this is just like an idea Again, it can get complicated. So we still left it here because we're going to hear more feedbacks. I don't know Tler. If you have your hand up, maybe you can shame me. I see your head up, baby. Refer to jump into the station man again.

Benjamin B: I have it up. Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: I'm just seeing the screen. So I don't see you from my phone. Sorry about that.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I want to say here that I think maybe we shouldn't have it just and I think this Mission and some of it will go to inside these years because they are the ones who usually have a coach merch right now, some people are against it. But as long as it's not reoccurring super often and they're just 10 minutes in the morning doing a mission and then they can do that every week as long as it's not like that. I think it's fine.

Robert Del Rey: Mm- Okay, not that makes sense All right moving on because time is taking Benjamin's taking.

00:35:00

Robert Del Rey: Okay, the working group Mission we have for this month and for context Tyler and so it can be in the reporting. We're gonna have three categories for the Nations. That way it's gonna be easier for us to come up with missions. The three categories are built on a cache. Which our missions that people build things on a cache or deploy your stuff on a cache or create a stuff on a cache?

Robert Del Rey: The second category is a cash content missions and those missions are about creating content about It can be content that they post on social media due to from Discord, but different color for those missions. We create AI power images for the month. We create AI power a cash videos or logos using sdxl. We're gonna see those submissions and the best of those are gonna win prices. Now, the third category is featured Mission or a cash working group Mission. And the reason for this one is the things that other working groups are doing and try to come up with City missions that can help.

Robert Del Rey: those working groups for example the first month They become a provider like cash Network the working group. We're trying to help it's the providers working group. for the month number two The mission is about Seeley is the working group for the month and the mission is invite reference to join the cash developer on board Initiative Program. I haven't brought that mission down yet, but that's the title invite three to five friends to join the peace developer initiative on silly. Let's see how it goes. The initial number was 10, but after speaking with bendy with lower it down to three to five and let's see how it goes.

Robert Del Rey: From personal experience. I've tried to invite 10 people to something with the related before and I haven't got any success. The only time I did it was actually because I only needed to invite three people. And that's the reason why I did it that only time. So, let's see how it goes. The mission is in by three to five friends to join their cash on boarding program on Sealy. I'm excited about that. let's see how that goes. And yeah, you can create a mission that people get a costly and they can share that link with a friend. And if that person joins silly we will be able to see. where that person came from so if Tyler invites reference to Seeley, I will be able to see their friends Tyler invited and how many of them

Robert Del Rey: so I guess it could be fun to try. And that's the mission for month three.

Robert Del Rey: four month three They built on a cash Discord. It's gonna be sorry guys. I don't know. I'm seeing kind of blurry now. I haven't used my glasses in the whole weekend. Give me one second. Let me get my glasses guys. I can't read.

Robert Del Rey: I feel Okay, I have been on. It's way better. I usually just use them if I want to see something from afar. I don't need them to see things that are close to me. but sometimes my vision gets blurry right So the mission for month three moving on it's another Akash. I got on Mission. It's about creating tools for vulnerability scanning and Reporting creative tools for vulnerability scanning and Reporting. That's another mission. We had in the cash hackathon. I don't remember if we got a submission for that.

00:40:00

Robert Del Rey: Maybe we have things like that in a cash already. I don't know you tell me guys. Have you seen this before either or Benji tools for their ability scanning and Reporting?

Tyler Wright: I think there's reporting tools to be honest. I don't know how important this necessarily is. I love the idea of that third category of things that service like cigs and working groups. I would say one thing to add is a potential Mission would be something around technical documentation. I know a lot of developers quote unquote seem like they're better at writing documentation than they are actually developing code, but all contributions are welcome, so it'd be great to have Something that's lower barrier of entry on the developer side for folks that want to conribute. Sig documentation or anything like that. So just

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, man.

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Robert Del Rey: All right, so moving on. We have the last content mission for month. Three. This one is gonna be really cool. Maybe Tyler you can see the title from here. Maybe when you can highlight it also. But it's about create an educational video about the history of cloud computing in a cache roll in the cloud compute Market. That's a big mission that I see it's about creating content, but it's not like many submissions. Yes. We want to have as many submissions as we can. But we really want to get Best of the Best.

Robert Del Rey: so I don't know maybe this video can be used later in the future for a cash edu. Maybe it can be used to share it on our social medias. How I see it is a 10 to 20 minute video like a documentary. So people can have the history of computing because not many people know about computer honestly now. Besides that also adding a cash Place In This Cloud Computing history. Go ahead Tyler.

Tyler Wright: I think that's a great Mission. I was just wondering and I just brainstorming out loud. I wonder if it can make it a mission to join the Akash Insider program and be an Insider for two months, and if you do that to be a zealy then you can earn a certain amount of akt. I know it's like most people that are in the entire program don't necessarily or an akt but I think we're trying to certainly find more technical insiders. And so, if we find anybody through zealy it might be a cool mission to do that is fun to throw that out there.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, Yeah, I can do that. I can create a mission become an Insider and the requirements we can have things like amount of months. We want them to be in the program two months like you say and another requirement that I can think right now. It's do at least one Bounty while you are an Insider or one contribution to a passion Network just to give an example, but is that something related to what you're saying, right?

Tyler Wright: That'd be perfect. I'm not doing inside. this out. because you get looking see for this potentially.

Robert Del Rey: I can create a destination in short to you and I can also share it in the office hours this week. No problem with that. Thank you. But…

Benjamin B: Yeah, I want to say something perfect.

Robert Del Rey: but Sorry to Interruption. And the last thing I wanted to say is that the missions are not targeted to current insiders. It's to people that we won them to become inside. There's and then after they become inside their state do things inside the program and earn some akt after they are in the program. That's what I wanted to say. Sorry. Now you can go ahead and you say about them.

Benjamin B: Also a mowers and I want to say that simply incentivizing the Insiders program and entering it and it could lead to spam users. I think we have a lot of insiders doing nothing already. I think if we could create a user password, they start in six and working groups and complete about this and everything like that if they can start there and then apply I think we should be reward those users definitely, but I don't think just because they become an Insider we should let them get Rewards.

00:45:00

Robert Del Rey: That's a great observation And maybe we can switch the order. Instead of incentivizing them to become an Insider to earn the price Maybe. We can wait until the end of the campaign. and the people that did the most missions and want the most money we can offer them to become an Insider right away without going to the interview. And that can be the price that's something else I can think right now, but I totally feel you when you say things like if we incentivize them just to join. We're gonna have lots of experiment. Yeah, I do believe we have a decent number of insiders now.

Robert Del Rey: So maybe this can be part of the prices. Maybe we can out to people that worry me. We are starting the silly campaign again. And now people who do 1,000 XP can get to the Insiders if they want to for example. That's one way we can put it. But yeah, I guess we should avoid incentivizing people to join inside this programming. We're gonna give you some prices. I know that is not what we said but it could be interpreted that way. right

Tyler Wright: Down I hear what you always saying. No argument. I'm not going to die in a hill actually argument. I'm to argue Counterpoint would be I get what you're saying about spam. But all that would do is they would span themselves into the inside or application. They would not get automatic acceptance. I would still have to go through. the onboarding process and to your point about

Tyler Wright: to your point about insiders I do understand exactly what you're saying. my hope is that by having these folks that come through zealy. So they're already have the chops that want to be more developer focused because they come through that platform and then they contribute I love the idea of earning a certain amount of XP points like a thousand so that people that join The Insider program or involved a fair amount about the network, but I feel like we can still get people to get to the application process if they go through that application process, which is a manual process and pasta interview, then they're in and they've still have to contribute over a period of time to potentially earn those rewards so there is a clear path, but again, Not until I'm not willing to die on so just wanted to put it out.

Robert Del Rey: What I will do is that I can create two test missions so we can have the two points of view One mission to pay you want to be an Insider. You can apply to the inside decision this link and we can make that a mission and another mission to we just

Robert Del Rey: yeah. I mean, it's gonna be only one Mission I had to become Insider. That's it. Yeah. I was sure a test mission with you so you can see it and maybe we can go from there but I believe It's worth it if we can explore how we put it. Because people are already involved into ceilings and you see this mission to become an Insider. Yeah, why wouldn't you try it out and try to become an Insider in case they decide to apply like you say Tyler they will go to the Insiders form and then go to the process of interview. and so if we get that expand it's gonna be good a span in the sense that we're gonna get traffic out of Sealy. I believe that's the main point you want to get across, right?

Robert Del Rey: So Yeah, I will work on a test mission and Venture with you. and with everybody But yeah, I'm super done. What? And yeah, that was all I guess. one second Benjamin before you go before you go I have the last mission now.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I have one more thing on this. problem first.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, I just wanted to confirm because I have the notification that you and someone else asked the handbook. But now as it's you and Tyler, Okay, no worries Go ahead and I thought it was thought someone else.

00:50:00

Benjamin B: Yeah, you were talking about tensionally having the price beat that they become an Insider. I think we can try to speak with Adam if we can not do that. But instead of that we can have so we can try to Fast Track them into the Insiders program. So if someone from Siri is active on silly. Plus they apply through Sealy. I think that we should Push that interview before other ones so they can skip the queue.

Robert Del Rey: Love it. Yeah, of course, right? Why not and like you say, they're gonna be earning XP and stuff. So it's gonna be easier for us to determine hey, yeah, this person deserves a class track into the application. If it's gonna be a proof or not that it's gonna go down to Adam. But yeah, I guess having Fast Track in the process gonna be good because yeah, I mean many people are always applying to the inside there's so maybe we can play through insiders now and Adam gets back to you in two months in one month depending on how many applications we have. So I guess fast tracking you in case you want to be inside there. It's gonna be great. Thank you so much Mike. the last mission I have for the day. It's

Robert Del Rey: it's for the events working group. And this one is about attending and in real life event. The example I did was eat Denver because it's the one that is coming up. The closest I guess but it can be an event and basically is X y c event and take a picture with the cash team at the event. That picture the guys need to share it on Tag a cash and use the hashtag super cloud again. This is a mission to make people create content and have it on social media.

Robert Del Rey: We don't have to price all the participants, but maybe we can. Give prices to the top three submissions or to of the best submissions. That's the last mission and Yeah with that. I close the 15 Missions at the moment that we have to this campaign. If you have any thoughts or feedbacks now, it's a good time for them then or Tyler

Robert Del Rey: Okay, thumbs down I will take that as no feedbacks and know that this is about mission right? I'm just kidding. so yeah, that's it. I will go ahead and go over the feedback. You gave me guys will analyze then you do and I will analyze together what missions will be too Brock to do them. And what missions are worth to have if people can come up with a good proof of concept I started was saying because at the end of the day, we don't want to

Robert Del Rey: Up, the next 10 million dollar application, but we want to have more people deciding to build on a cash and saying hey, I believe this is something that I can do. Let me do it even though it's ugly. Let me do it on a cache because they have this Mission really. So let me do this. that's how I believe people think when they see these nations. Go ahead Benjamin.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I just want to say that when we update the proposal in another way and we add this Mission so that people can read it. I think that we should also include that these are the ideas that we have but we should leave it open in case we want to change it because some missions down the road maybe we decide yeah, this is a bad one or we can have a better one. But we…

Robert Del Rey: Mm-hmm

Benjamin B: but we will list the 15 ones as examples that will likely make the cuts.

Robert Del Rey: God and yes, I also believe we should add them all. And also maybe we're not adding them now, but that doesn't mean we won't add them in another campaign in the future, right because I'm not planning on stopping this and I know you're not neither Benji. So yeah, maybe those missions that right now we are disregarding. Maybe those will be the highlight missions on the next months of these. Who knows right only the future will tell. But yeah, that's all I got for today about the proposal going on Shane. We are preparing for that Tyler.

Robert Del Rey: And those listening to the recording the goal we have is submitting The Proposal on chain for this Friday. That's the goal we have but if things happen that prevent us of doing that we want to meet the proposal on Shane if we're not ready yet, but that's the goal we have for this week. And yeah, yeah, that's all for this call guys. It was the initials we're gonna offer for the three months campaign of the Sealy. We went over the titles. We spoke a little of some of them. We got some good feedback, which I'm gonna address right now in the next 30 minutes after this call. And the proposal going on Shane when we are ready.

00:55:00

Robert Del Rey: So with that being said guys, do you have any last comment you want to share or anything before we wrap this column?

Robert Del Rey: All right, I will take that as I know and with that being said, thank you guys for joining and thank you for those listening to the recording. If you have any questions about the cash developer on board initiative on silly you can go to a cash this course see this Channel and rub your questions there or you can send me at the end to Robert Del Rey if you want to With that being said guys. Thank you again for joining and See you when I see you. Okay?

Benjamin B: Thank everyone for today. I will.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you Tyler also.

Benjamin B: Try to

Tyler Wright: Thank you. Let me know.
