Robert Del Rey: Silly I cash ceiling working group called. This is the second call after the campaign officially started and I got a few items in the agenda. Seems Benji won't be able to join today. That's okay. The recording will be available on GitHub. And a quick update I was able to update the last call into the Sealy working group. I don't know how to call if it's a threat a Blog but in the silly working group in the cash GitHub, you will be able to find the last recording and also this one in the next one and the next one. So yeah the agenda for today.

Robert Del Rey: it's gonna be about The missions we review some submissions. Some people are not getting Rewards. Also missions that we posted and we're going to post in different groups of a cash, Discord.

Robert Del Rey: There is social media activity coming up by the end of the month. also resources to help people make missions and let me add one quick update about Seeley it's trying to prevent some scam communities and there is something we almost do if we want to continue with this community. I will leave that one by the end. So guys unless you have any other topic that I didn't mention I will go ahead and start with the items of the agenda. Go ahead Scott.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks for reminding men and no Nobody got back with me on that honestly. me write it down to…

Scott Hewitson: Okay. my God,…

Robert Del Rey: because he

Scott Hewitson: I don't know Ty is able to do it. I know he made it said Corey, but it not I'll take Corey today make sure that gets done.

Tyler Wright: So can you reiterate I might have missed this while I was at I apologize. what is with the roles that need to be done? Because I can make sure that gets done today.

Robert Del Rey: thanks Tyler's man.

Robert Del Rey: if we connect I catch this score and silly. It's gonna be easier for us to assign Rose to people and also track where they go within a cash Discord. This has nothing to do with the silly update. I just mentioned this is something else. So if it's possible to have those silly rolls at it, that'd be great. And yeah.

Tyler Wright: Did you put a note in the zealy channel? I just need to find that note so I can just go a little bit more information. I apologize you.

Robert Del Rey: It's a good man. No worries. Yeah, I can get it for you. I

Scott Hewitson: Yeah. I'm gonna at you and it

Tyler Wright: Okay. beautiful

Robert Del Rey: Mmm, thanks Scott.

Scott Hewitson: there you go.

Scott Hewitson: I got you fam.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, yeah, I know so. Yeah, that. We're gonna go over that in a second. So yeah, the most important thing is that we were reviewing missions. We are over the hundred submissions Mark already. We have some good submissions, but we also have some low quality and copy work missions Benji and I did a review session. We sat down for two hours going over each Mission and a second some rejecting Suddenly, he's not here to showcase the developing missions, but I'm here to show Two submissions that we have from a stable diffusion.

Robert Del Rey: Let me see if I can share the screen. window, okay, let me know if you guys can see it

Scott Hewitson: Yep, I can see it.

Robert Del Rey: Awesome, so we have this one. That I like a lot. And this one? I don't know how to feel about this one yet. But at least it's a cash.

Robert Del Rey: so yeah, those are two of the bestest images that we found with there are a few more but these two. I think we're worthy. The Highlight. I would share them on this court too later today. There are some building missions. Like I said, but Benji was supposed to Showcase those. I wish I could with him after this cold. No worries guys. But based on that reviewing session we sent a reminder in the description. So guys can keep in mind that We are here To do the missions, But we have to make an effort and the advice was to avoid doing low quality low effort and copy work missions.

00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: Maybe we can send that reminder on a weekly basis, but we never sent that reminder before so it's okay if they did some spammy submissions. Hopefully it decreased now. But yeah. that I don't have this stack number like the legit submissions. But like I said, we are over the 100 people Mark, which is a very nice. If you have any questions about this one, I will move to the next Topic in the agenda.

Scott Hewitson: Do whatever you'd like because you're already crushing it.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, That's a good one. I have used the pin message feature. I believe having this reminder will also benefit. Thank you so much Scott.

Robert Del Rey: And let me write it down. I only can do one thing at a time once that

Scott Hewitson: you're holding that money. You got to do the mic drop and you can right.

Robert Del Rey: Man, this is already green message But I got it. Thank you so much guys, so moving on the next topic. It's about the feature missions the working group missions as GTC and kufcon are happening this week. If I'm not mistaken. We open up a missions. It's attend to cook Comfortis take a picture with their cash theme of the other people you find there. And you might have a chance to win some akt just a little context. The reason why I want people to do that is because I want a small as most support as we can have in social media.

Robert Del Rey: So having different people posting on social media. Hey, I'm here with the cash team that could help the numbers on social media. I know it's not fun experiment if you ask me. So That's the Fisher mission that we had for last week. We opened it up and I shared them in the events group in the silly groups. But also the temporary groups that Adam created let him letting people know that they have that opportunity in case they want to take advantage of it because that's the good thing about it. It's not mandatory that they do missions. But if they want to do the missions they have missions to do. For this week. The Fisher mission is going to be the providers mission.

Robert Del Rey: Around Wednesday or Thursday. I will go ahead and share them and remind providers that we do have a providers mission in case they provide some resources to a cash Network and meet the criteria that we have. They can earn some extra akt. Besides whatever they're getting paid if they're getting paid by providing resources on a cash. So yeah, that's the Highlight mission of this week. They providers Mission. Let's see how it goes any questions on this topic in particular.

Robert Del Rey: If not, that's okay. Thank you so much. The next one is short. Also, it's the Twitter Spaces by the end of the Sprint. I share it with my good friends of cosmosa spaces. They have a validator on a cash and a few other networks in the cosmos ecosystem across the spaces is a big validator and they do lots of spaces. They have a big following too and most importantly within friends for almost two years. So it's a good relationship that we have. the thing is that by the end of this month. We're aiming for March 25th next Monday.

00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: We're gonna do a Twitter spaces so we can update Their audience about how we see doing and how people can take advantage of a cash silly and how to get involved. So basically I want to leverage their following on the cosmos ecosystem so I can share this serious stuff and hopefully get more people in the silly train. We are thinking of doing a small giveaway for the people that joined the spaces. And hopefully they join and they win the prices that we have available for everybody. Like I said, the day is going to be next Monday. That way we have one week remaining from the Sprint and we can also remind people that another Sprint is coming up for month number two.

Robert Del Rey: It sounds like a good plan. Let's see how it is in practice, but I'm very optimistic about it. And I believe social media campaign. It's also very important because we can be sending reminders in the group chats. Right? But if Outsiders don't see this on social media, it's gonna be uphill battle to try to get more in new people to try this campaign. yeah, and I want more. that on the touristspaces topic. the following topics are limited Power Man. that the other one is that we did a FAQ document. The frequently asked questions document. We sent that last week people like it.

Robert Del Rey: And we just added the most common questions. We got so far, if people have to do missions on mainnet or testnet. And if they have to connect their wallet to participate we clarify that over there too. So yeah at the moment it's like five six questions, but there are the most questions that these people have asked so far. Everybody can comment in case somebody joins and want to drop a feedback. They can comment the feedback. And also I pin that message in this course, so it's easy to find. And yeah, that's that with About the city role. Let's go back to that one.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, I was saying yeah, it's just having roles. There is not much work to do on that. if you want to do what just let me know we can do that in two minutes. You just have to be admin in their cash silly community and connect the silly Community with a cash Discord after you connect that we're gonna create a mission. It's a template so it's not too hard. So the silly Community can claim their City role and that role is going to be added in their Discord profile. I don't know if you noticed that my profile for example, it sets server booster. inside there. It says Bangor by having this silly role.

Robert Del Rey: Everybody doing silly missions are gonna have a silly role in their Discord profile. It might not mean much but even as recognition people like that and I believe it's good to have it and go ahead.

Tyler Wright: I think this all makes sense. I guess my one question is am I a admin as Corey and admin and zealy? I'm not sure if that's the case and…

Robert Del Rey: Either I will need to add you.

Tyler Wright: okay so we might Yeah, so if you could add me as an admin and zealy at my

Tyler Wright: Akash email that would be great and then if there's a link I'm looking at the link that was shared by

Tyler Wright: But was reshare by Huey, but was originally shared by you Robert and it makes a lot of sense if there's any reference that you can provide from zealy just because I'm in conversational Corey right now. I just want to make sure from the security standpoint. He's feeling comfortable and then I can let loose from there. But I see there's a quick screenshot that she dropped in here if there's Any other information? I'm sure I can find it too is really. to school

Robert Del Rey: Maybe I'll go ahead and also send you an example of how the city role looks like in your account after you have it.

00:15:00

Tyler Wright: actually

Tyler Wright: You know what? No, I'm good. I found a quick link. That's from zealy.io their documentation integrating into Discord.

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Tyler Wright: I think this is all Cory would need. To make a determination.

Robert Del Rey: Awesome, man.

Tyler Wright: So yeah, if you can add me as an admin. Then once I hear back from Corey saying That we should be in a good place.

Robert Del Rey: If you don't mind this page, you can see the members. This is Fiverr. Benji has the same permits as I do and this is Andrew. I don't know if Andres aware of this is still let me

Robert Del Rey: let me ask him. Yes review Okay, so Thai I have At a cash Network. That's it.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, Costa Network. Yes.

Robert Del Rey: By l e r at a cash dot Network, awesome Please I have seven eight nine. Yes.

Tyler Wright: Yes, Am I social security number is not just kidding. right

Scott Hewitson: What's your speed trays?

Tyler Wright: got it.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I got it.

Scott Hewitson: Don't looks like he dropped off. there we go.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, that was quick. Sorry about that.

Tyler Wright: No, no, I received the invite so much appreciated.

Robert Del Rey: Good good. Okay, and the last thing I want to cover it's about the Sealy. Update so last week. They posted that they noticed a rice in a scam communities. Some people are creating communities to scam people which is super bad. So what are they are doing they are? Certifying communities they are like betting communities as you can I'm not sharing the screen yet. Let me share again. I won't end this call this time. I promise. Okay, so as you can see here, we are still under the free plan and we are on listed.

Robert Del Rey: is not that they are gonna delete all of this and throw our work away. No, but as long as we are unlisted our community' In the search if you search for A cash Community is not going to appear. Also, if you go to Sealy web page directly. They highlight communities. these are mines. But here you can see new communities silly highlight new communities and that helps to get a few extra more people. But as long as we remain unlisted, there is no way silly highlighters here. So I already asked what needs to be done in order for us to be verified.

Robert Del Rey: and I close silly. And basically we have to buy the Long story short. Yeah, if you have the monthly plan, they certify you right away. The planet the moment just so we're still gonna need to buy it. And I will explain that in a second. But the starting plan is starting at a little less than $200 a month. This will give us some things. the limit to claim Quest at the moment we have 5,000 XP per month, which is nice. The issue comes when we want to export the data. We can only export up to 100 members. And during the pilot this work.

Robert Del Rey: Because all the submissions were less than 100 but since we went over this number already, I believe we would need to get at least the standard monthly plan so we can go up to 1,000 when we're exporting the data. like I said as soon as you upgrade. your profile is gonna be certified right away and we still gonna have a chance again to appear in the main page and also if any random person wants to search for a cash And they search for a cash. They will be able to find it since we are going to be certified.

00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: So that is what I wanted to drop about that cash silly update. It's good. That funding hasn't been an issue with this. One thing that I was speaking with paint is we need to accept some missions and we need to get more people doing this Mission so we can get to the Depending number that we planned before starting this Mission. I guess that's a good problem to have. And since we also get some extra funding by Greg which we're gonna be super eternally grateful. I believe $200 for the next three month is gonna be $600. I think we can do it and we have to do it since it's gonna help us get in the data and it's gonna help us being highlighted in the main page. And yeah. Even though we are legit.

Robert Del Rey: If a new random person find this and see us as unlisted in red like that, they're not gonna feel very confident about trying out a cash City. So yeah, I guess this is something that must be done at least for that three months of the real campaign. After we're done with the campaign, I don't know. What we're gonna do I was reading and we can cancel. anytime if is the annual plan which We're not gonna go with that one. So as soon as the three months and we can cancel that and then we can get to decide what we're gonna do after.

Robert Del Rey: But yeah guys those are all my topics. We went over the missions review the feature missions with the events and the providers missions for next week. The Twitter spaces that's coming up next week the FAQs and the resources for the community members the city rolls and the silly updates. So that's all I had for you guys. Thank you for joining and those listening to the recording. Anything else you want to discuss before we wrap it up go ahead tie.

Tyler Wright: Sorry, I'm looking for I know that you talked about the Twitter spaces. Is there a link that we can put a couple of places? So that's easier for people to access can we put something on Discord events? Do you have all that kind of stuff set up yet already or you just let me know when that's good to go and then just dropping the zealy channel and then we can just like Reddit wherever we need to spread it.

Tyler Wright: You're on mute.

Scott Hewitson: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I think yeah.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, I was commuted. This mic work, it's harder today. I don't know…

Tyler Wright: Yes. Yes, please I want to

Robert Del Rey: Okay. Thank you guys Scott.

Scott Hewitson: Yeah in regards to the Twitter spaces. it's awesome here. You're always plugging into other communities you're doing. I mean getting the word out as something you do. totally appreciate that. maybe one thing you can highlight while you're talking about them is just the mere fact that this program is a community program that was through the community like you did Pilots you did this and it's completely Community owned. It's kind of a cool story because it's from zero you can have resources to put up together a whole program and this is the prime example of that. Just the random,…

Robert Del Rey: That's right, Good.

Scott Hewitson: throw it out because our process is, we want people who are building or doing things the progress the network to get funding like ASAP and there's multiple Avenues to do so.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, man, absolutely. Sure sure that that's a great one, And I can feel your we say it because I love it I'm that example this came from zero We went from zero to Seeley this.

Scott Hewitson: Yeah, you're the prime example. That's right.

00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, man, I love to talk more about that. You got it.

Tyler Wright: Yes, please from zero to zealy. That's a quotable right there,

Scott Hewitson: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: I just made that up. Thank you. So guys thats that for now anything else you want to cover?

Scott Hewitson: yeah, one other thing on the Twitter spaces if you're doing planning on doing a giveaway or something, but you don't have the funds we can always do a 50 hundred dollar Bounty something like that similar to the spaces. You did a while ago. Those are offers that will always be able to do just with the community support funds so Please let me know if you need that.

Robert Del Rey: I should wear I sure will my guys again. Thank you for your support. It's great working with you. Again. If you have any other feedback any other idea that might be fun to try making a mission out. Just let me know. We're working on some new missions. To unveil on the second month and Benji and I are super excited about how things are going. So if you want to still drop more wisdom as you have done in the past, please do it anytime anytime.
