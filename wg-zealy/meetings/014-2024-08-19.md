## Meeting Notes

### Akash Zealy Campaign Overview and Progress

- During this interim period, Robert will:
  - Review completed missions
  - Calculate associated rewards
  - Process payments for participants
- The upcoming second sprint will introduce additional missions to engage participants

### Current Sprint Status

- The campaign has attracted a total of 38 participants
- Among these, 25 are new members to the Akash community
- Despite recent market fluctuations, participation levels remain robust
- Robert expressed satisfaction with the strong participation, especially considering the campaign is only two weeks old

### Mission Updates and New Missions

#### Twitter Writer Mission Modifications:

- The "how to stake" guide has been removed from the list of suggested topics
- Emphasis has been placed on content originality
- Remaining topic suggestions include:
  - First-time deployment processes on Akash
  - Tutorials on using Akash console and praetor
  - Compelling use case stories featuring Akash
  - Comparative analyses between Akash and similar crypto projects

#### Newly Introduced Missions:

- Invite Friends Mission:
  - Participants are tasked with inviting 3 friends to successfully complete at least one mission
  - Successful completion rewards 15 XP points (equivalent to 1.5 AKT)
  - This mission can be undertaken once per month for a three-month period
  - A stern warning was issued against inviting bots to participate

- Lava Network Provider Mission:
  - Participants are challenged to become a Lava Network provider for any supported blockchain
  - The provider service must be deployed on the Akash network
  - Successful completion offers a substantial reward of 50 AKT (500 XP points)
  - This mission aims to foster integration between the Lava Network and Akash
  - Supported networks encompass Cosmos, Axelar, Celo, Filecoin, among others

### Working Group Call Attendance

- A notable increase in attendance for working group calls has been observed
- This uptick is attributed to the integration of working group call missions in the campaign
- Upcoming calls featuring missions include:
  - Design Working Group scheduled for Tuesday, August 20th
  - Steering Committee meeting set for Thursday, August 22nd
- Participants can earn additional points (8 tokens) by submitting secret words from these calls
- Those who have already submitted words for previous calls must wait for the next sprint to earn points again

### New Mission Strategy

- The campaign is adopting a dynamic approach by introducing new missions throughout the sprint
- While an initial set of missions was published at the campaign's outset, additional challenges will be released as the sprint progresses
- This strategy aims to re-engage participants who might have initially felt certain missions were beyond their capabilities

### Project Showcase

- Rodri R provided a live demonstration of deploying an RPC node for the Tia network on Akash
- The demonstration utilized the devnet on the Akash sandbox
- A GitHub repository containing detailed instructions was shared with attendees
- Rodri noted that the process could be adapted for other Cosmos SDK-based blockchains with minor adjustments
- A discussion ensued regarding potential improvements for mission requirements and rewards:
  - Suggestions included allowing the Lava Network Provider mission on the Sandbox to mitigate costs
  - Proposals were made to adjust rewards based on whether deployments occur on mainnet or sandbox environments

### Q&A and Discussion

- Robert encouraged participants to propose ideas for custom missions
- The campaign's primary focus on showcasing Akash's capabilities and pushing its limits was reiterated
- Participants were invited to utilize the Akash Discord channel for questions, suggestions, and ongoing discussions
