### Current Sprint Status

- The campaign has attracted a total of 38 participants
- Among these, 25 are new members to the Akash community
- Despite recent market fluctuations, participation levels remain robust
- Robert expressed satisfaction with the strong participation, especially considering the campaign is only two weeks old

### Mission Updates and New Missions

  - Comparative analyses between Akash and similar crypto projects

#### Newly Introduced Missions:

- Invite Friends Mission:
  - Participants are tasked with inviting 3 friends to successfully complete at least one mission
  - Successful completion rewards 15 XP points (equivalent to 1.5 AKT)
  - This mission can be undertaken once per month for a three-month period
  - A stern warning was issued against inviting bots to participate

  - The provider service must be deployed on the Akash network
  - Successful completion offers a substantial reward of 50 AKT (500 XP points)
  - This mission aims to foster integration between the Lava Network and Akash
  - Supported networks encompass Cosmos, Axelar, Celo, Filecoin, among others

### Working Group Call Attendance

- A notable increase in attendance for working group calls has been observed
- This uptick is attributed to the integration of working group call missions in the campaign
- Upcoming calls featuring missions include:
  - Design Working Group scheduled for Tuesday, August 20th
  - Steering Committee meeting set for Thursday, August 22nd
- Participants can earn additional points (8 tokens) by submitting secret words from these calls
- Those who have already submitted words for previous calls must wait for the next sprint to earn points again

### New Mission Strategy

- The campaign is adopting a dynamic approach by introducing new missions throughout the sprint
- While an initial set of missions was published at the campaign's outset, additional challenges will be released as the sprint progresses
- This strategy aims to re-engage participants who might have initially felt certain missions were beyond their capabilities

### Project Showcase

- Rodri R provided a live demonstration of deploying an RPC node for the Tia network on Akash
- The demonstration utilized the devnet on the Akash sandbox
- A GitHub repository containing detailed instructions was shared with attendees
- Rodri noted that the process could be adapted for other Cosmos SDK-based blockchains with minor adjustments
- A discussion ensued regarding potential improvements for mission requirements and rewards:
  - Suggestions included allowing the Lava Network Provider mission on the Sandbox to mitigate costs
  - Proposals were made to adjust rewards based on whether deployments occur on mainnet or sandbox environments

### Q&A and Discussion

# **Transcript**

Robert Del Rey: right recording and transcribing or write everybody. Thank you for joining and welcome to these. version of the cash developer rewarding campaign on ceiling you got excuse me today. I'm feeling like a little sick. Maybe that's why.

Robert Del Rey: Also my chest hurts, I don't know what's going on. so in this call guys, we're gonna follow up and discuss all things around the cash silly company. the first of three sprinters started on the first of this month of August. And we're approaching the end of the first spring. I wanted to give you the heads of the screen and on Friday the 30th. So participants have a little over. One weekend something almost.

Robert Del Rey: Almost the weeks. Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: To speed up and make sure those two missions are made. Once the spring ends. The next one is going to start. a few days after doing that time I will continue reviewing missions calculating the rewards and at the same time paying those rewards after we do the math for the first state.

Robert Del Rey: so second experience is gonna bring more missions Beyond the lookout for that. But let's speak about the correctly guys. at the moment there are 25 new members in the community participating in the silly company in a total of 38 members participating in this spring. So we are very eight people participating in the Stream in 25 out of those 38 are new people in the ash community. Which is something to celebrate, I believe I mean the spring that started two weeks ago and we had a makeup in the market. I don't know if you guys remember so that didn't stop people for joining up this campaign and I believe we have a solid number just two weeks into his campaign.

Robert Del Rey: I will stop for a quick second unless Anybody has anything to add about the second screen and how it's going so far guys. Are you liking Missions at the moment? Do you think we could do? Something better. I like to hear some of your voices today.

Robert Del Rey: that's not really fine. Remember to drop any suggestion chat in cash Discord almost available in the DMs. So, yeah, let's move on. Tell me I don't know if you don't know me. He's an attached Insider. He has suggested two missions actually, and then we're gonna shut about those.

Robert Del Rey: I wanted to say it's pretty cool. One of them is actually about deploying and hosting your personal website on a cache. We don't have a mission about that. So it will be cool. To bring that up and there is another one that I have about later. But yeah, we beat a quick fix in one of the missions. It's called the writer in the Twitter writer Michel just to give your little context.

Robert Del Rey: We are requesting people. To write anything about a cash it can be an use cases about tutorials. about all the things that you can do on a cash Network. one of those things though was how to escape guide But with figure last week that since we already had a lot of that content about how to stay on a cash, we would remove that out of the list. So in the list you're gonna find the topics like how to do your first deployment on a cache how to use their cash console pretor. case of stories about a cash like I mentioned Or comparing the cash to similar crypto projects

Robert Del Rey: and other topics, basically the originality is the key in these missions. So yeah, Let's see what you come up with but how to take Mission they help just take a mission. That one was removed. Artification just going to give you the heads up.


### 00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: Thank you so much guys.

Robert Del Rey: All right moving up in the India again that guys in the past two weeks. We have been noticing and increase in the attendance in the working group calls. And we feel very good about that because we think that it has With the working group called missions that we have In those missions, we are invited people to join the seeds and working group calls that a cash has throughout the weeks. And we've seen a substantial increase in attendance. So keep up that work guys and besides the points you get for those missions when we really want is you to get involved in the different aspects of Action Network. so yeah, everybody happy about the attendance so far for this week. There are going to be only two calls.

Robert Del Rey: That have missions one of them is the The Design working group. it's happening tomorrow Tuesday. And the steering committee It's happening on Thursday. I believe confirm. it's happening on Thursday the second. So those two calls are gonna have If you submit that secret word, you will get some extra points some extra 80 tokens. If you're already submitted the word it's not gonna work. I get it. You have to wait. For the next Sprint if you want to just leave the word again. So, guys. And yeah, those are most of the topics that I have. I wanted to get those out of the way and showcase you the two new missions, we're gonna have

Robert Del Rey: Something that we decided to improve upon during these campaign was they continuity about the mission? How we need it in the NASA screen is that we had a set of missions. We would just publish that And yeah, that was still. But in this campaign, we're going to do it a little bit different. We're gonna open up the street with a few set of missions.

Robert Del Rey: I'll wait through the Sprint. We're gonna release New Missions for you guys. We believe that can motivate people to try again. Maybe you saw the missions in the first week and you talk to yourself that you couldn't do them. So we're going to release that next batch of missions and hopefully that can give people a chance to participate in this company. So I will share my screen real quick. So that you can see the two new missions we're going to have for you.

Robert Del Rey: So that's

Robert Del Rey: all righty.

Robert Del Rey: I'm trying to screen now. Let me know if you guys.

Benjamin B: I can see.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks All right, so the First new Mission it's gonna be available as soon as this call and this region is gonna be able it's about inviting your friends to see this was actually a suggestion we had in one of the working group calls. I believe it was last weekend. But invite three friends to do the missions. They have to do at least one Mission successfully or the invite account. And after you complete the three invites you will get 15 XP points, which is 1.58. It's not much but it's a good price. All right.


### 00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: Yeah. numbers of invitations require so you can copy your invite link here. That is what you share with your friends. when they click on your link and do one mission that is gonna count here. You don't have to submit anything you need to come here then invite the people and when doing by the tree the mission is gonna build you.

Robert Del Rey: Sure.

Robert Del Rey: yeah. you have

Robert Del Rey: yeah, man, you're right. Let's do that right away that makes more sense. Nice catchment thank you for that. So yeah guys three invites and you get the extra points. And again this is gonna be available to you monthly. So for the whole three months, you can do these three times, please don't invite Bots to the server, please invite real people. All right.

Robert Del Rey: It also So I hope you that you like the next mission more. This one is more exciting. I don't know if you heard the news lava Network. It's on magnet and then good job. So this is the mission guys we want. participants To become a lava network provider. He can be any network. And as long as it's deployed on a cash. And you run it.

Robert Del Rey: You will get this price. Let me give a little context for lava. Maybe you heard about lava, maybe not so let me provide you a little context. So lava network is like an RPC Network. So the promise is that you can become an obviously provider for any let's say you want to provide services for Solana. And you can have that on lava if you have that provider on lava, you will get lava tokens and you can do that with. I don't know a few networks. I've seen ethereum Solana and a few others. So basically this is going to require more effort guys. But you can get double rewards you will get rewards from the Akash side as you can see. The reward is 50 AKP. You heard that right 50.

Robert Del Rey: or 500 XP points

Robert Del Rey: So you might need to get into lava Discord. You might need to get into a cash list to ask questions. You might need to get extra documentation. But we want you. To make this as well as it works. We don't care how you do it right just follow up the instructions here. the first requirement says use your creativity as long as your bill integrates, the two networks. The submission will be good. I'm not saying it's gonna be a truth right away, but it's gonna be with for sure. So again, you become a lava Network provider of any support chain that they have and you host that on a cash and you will win. Let me see that. A brief second and go to the level documents.

Robert Del Rey: Real quickly. So as you can see, these are the networks that they support you see Cosmos UC based acceler and most file coin. There is lower cash one though. Maybe we could do another mission about creating an Akash file for here. Who knows but yeah, these are the networks and you can provide RPC services. So we want you to get one of these. Run it. And host it on a cash for it to count. So yeah, Maybe it doesn't make sense. We want to see what you guys can build. Remember that the whole model of this new city campaign is pushing a cash to the limits showcasing the possibilities of a cash. So let's build guys. Let's feel I want to take a moment and say that if you

Robert Del Rey: Come up with a crazy idea you want to build? I don't know feel free to reach out to us and let us know what you're building and we might create a custom mission for you so you could make 80 tokens. Alright? Remember guys, this is all about building. So yeah, I will stop right now. I already shared that two new missions with you. Hopefully that makes you want to do more missions. And Remember Sprint number two is coming on then screen number three and then it's gonna be lots. We have 25 to 30 missions so you can do it, but we're gonna do it progressively little by little so yeah, that is all that I wanted to say on this call. If I'm not mistaken. This is the agenda. Am I still sharing the screen I know. yeah, I want to take


### 00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: Sorry, I wouldn't. I want to open up for some Q&A questions or session that will be a good time and also will be enough time before Benjamin has to drop off this call, which is coming soon.

Rodri R: That I didn't hear…

Robert Del Rey: Nobody, that's all…

Rodri R: what you were asking.

Robert Del Rey: Saving the day. What's up, man?

Rodri R: But I don't have a question,…

Robert Del Rey: No,…

Rodri R: but I did want to showcase one of the missions that I tried deploying a RPC.

Robert Del Rey: are you said that? Is somebody had a question? Now it's a good time to drop your questions.

Rodri R: I told this to then a few days ago, and I'm wanted to do this puzzle right now because I had to leave in about 10 minutes. So awesome let me see how

Robert Del Rey: That'd be awesome to make sure sure.

Rodri R: or for sharing the screen here

Robert Del Rey: Can you share the screen?

Rodri R: present now

Robert Del Rey: You're gonna be the reactions like the Emoji.

Robert Del Rey: it's right next to the race and…

Rodri R: Okay.

Robert Del Rey: In between the hand rays and the emoji for the reactions.

Rodri R: I'll see so I already give the repo.

Robert Del Rey: There you go.

Rodri R: on the mission for this network of Tia, which This is just one of the ways that you can run this RPC. You can also do it with the ugly worlds option. to make this quicker I already deployed the RPC here on devnet on the sandbox As you can see, this is the same. sdl As you can find here in the repo.

Rodri R: if this one

Rodri R: like I said that because I have to go in a few minutes. I already did all the steps. for the Snapchat you use a snapchat to catch up quicker with the network.

Rodri R: This one is As already changed I got you. It's a new Snapchat. It changes I guess every day or so. And here's the note running.

Rodri R: if you see here the new snapshot.

Rodri R: Yeah, all the instructors are in the repo. And this will work for that for other. people This will work for other cosmosis Decay based blockchains the same as the will only need to. Change the snapshot that has been used.

Rodri R: So yeah.

Robert Del Rey: awesome, brother Thank you so much, This looks really cool.

Rodri R: All Awesome that then I'll be having this one too. I'll be most two two, but just wanted to share this. Other form of deploying Cosmos as the case and on a cash and yeah, everything's playing here.


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: And thank you for your example. …

Rodri R: No problem.

Robert Del Rey: this is what we want to see in this type. Of course, we want you to step in and show us what you're building. Let me ask you Brody to make the mission better. Maybe for the participants. What do you think about the relation between the effort you did for this mission? They cost you pay and the price that you will get.

Robert Del Rey: Do you think the prices for the process or…

Rodri R: I really don't even remember…

Robert Del Rey: when the new modification could be improved?

Rodri R: what the price is, but I do remember asking you and then that it should probably be allowed to run on Sandbox. because if we have to keep the deployment going I guess for a week or two. I mean for this one as you can see it cuts. 11 on Sandbox I'm not sure probably will go about the same one. a mainnet, so That's why I rented here.

Robert Del Rey: All right. Thanks for sharing. I guess Benjamin I can go over that and Maybe if it makes more sense to have this mission on the sandbox best to that. because I want people to get motivated for the price but Maybe the cost to do this could be an issue. So maybe the sandbox is more attractive option if you want people to test this out.

Rodri R: Yeah. and…

Robert Del Rey: So yeah,…

Rodri R: I mean just I…

Robert Del Rey: thanks for sharing an experience.

Rodri R: I mean If I was gonna spend five akt maybe or for one or two weeks until we all can have time to review the submission. for some people might not want to leave it running I believe the price is 15 AKA or something that Excel remember it would be like you have part of the price maybe for running on Main? or at least two or…

Robert Del Rey: Yeah.

Rodri R: ATT Europe something that

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, All right.

Robert Del Rey: Let's see if any other get a topics. All right. thanks for joining then. You're right. Talk to you of line.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah guys, I mean I run over my topics already right now. I'm reading having this call. But after this call, I will continue reviewing the content creation submissions. One of the community members I wrote those. He did a really good guy deploying Golan ethereum in the castle remember exactly what but it was very solid. Yeah. Besides that I don't have any other optic for you guys. Just thank you again for joining again. If you come up with a questions or ideas we have these per channel in a cache Discord the cash CD Channel and yeah, we're gonna meet again.

Robert Del Rey: Next Monday at the same time and it's gonna be a few days before the print ends. Good luck for the In this first Sprint and let's keep on working guys. How about I go ahead?
