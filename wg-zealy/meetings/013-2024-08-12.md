  - **Mission Participation:** Observations indicate that members are particularly interested in missions related to joining working group calls.
    - Participants are motivated by earning points for submitting a "secret word" shared during the call, which contributes to their leaderboard rankings.
    - High attendance reported in recent working group calls, with 9 people joining the Economic SIG-Economics and 7 people joining the Website Working Group.
  - **Reminder:** Robert reminded attendees that submissions must include the correct secret word to be accepted. Incorrect submissions will be rejected, but members will have another chance to resubmit.

- **Technical Missions:**
  - There were mentions of technical missions, such as deploying RPC nodes on Akash, but Robert has not yet reviewed these submissions. No additional insights were provided during the meeting.

- **Mission Participation and Rewards:**
  - **Benjamin B:** Noted that even though the rewards for missions are not high, there is significant user participation.
  - **Robert Del Rey:** Emphasized the balance between prize value and participation. Although current participation might be lower, he is optimistic about the quality of submissions that will benefit the community.

- **Mission Review Process:**
  - **Feedback for Benjamin B:** 
    - Robert encouraged Benjamin to share any observations or improvements regarding mission reviews in the Zealy Discord channel.
    - Benjamin agreed and suggested updating mission descriptions if issues are found, such as the need for more specific instructions. He mentioned that initial missions might be approved despite errors if they are due to unclear instructions.

- **Community Involvement:**
  - **Robert Del Rey:** 
    - Stressed the importance of community feedback for improving the campaign. He encouraged participants to provide suggestions to enhance the campaign for everyone involved.
    - Highlighted that the campaign is not only for the Akash community but also reaches the broader Zealy community, which helps with visibility and engagement.

- **Secret Word for Zealy Mission:**
  - **Robert Del Rey:** Shared the secret word "DeCloud" (same as last week) for attendees to submit for extra points in the Zealy mission. Reminder that submissions are allowed only once per month, and previously approved submissions cannot be resubmitted.

- **Upcoming Calls for Extra Points:**
  - Robert outlined four upcoming calls that are part of the Zealy missions:
    - **Tuesday:** SIG Chain Monthly Call and SIG Community Monthly Meeting.
    - **Wednesday:** SIG Design Call.
    - **Thursday:** SIG Analytics Monthly Meeting.
  - Participants attending these calls will be able to earn extra points by submitting the correct secret word shared during the call.

- **Opening More Missions Mid-Sprint:**
  - **Robert Del Rey:** Proposed opening up additional missions halfway through the Sprint to maintain engagement and attract more community members. 
    - Idea to release two new missions related to building on Akash: one for deploying a Lava RPC node on Akash Mainnet and another for creating a trusted community RPC node for Akash.
    - Robert emphasized the importance of announcing these new missions to ensure community awareness and drive participation.

- **Twitter Campaign Updates:**
  - Robert mentioned that a tweet about the campaign is going out today, and a tweet asking for feedback will be published next Monday.

- **Q&A Session:**
  - **Encouraging Questions:** 
    - Robert Del Rey invited participants to ask questions if they are facing roadblocks or need help with their missions. He emphasized that the community is eager to support members in completing their builds and learning how to use Akash.
    - Suggested reaching out for help in group channels, Akash’s Discord, or community chats.
  
  - **Mission Support:** 
    - Robert highlighted that the goal of the Zealy campaign is to guide people through the process of discovering and using Akash, not just to distribute rewards.
    - Encouraged members to invite others who might be interested in Akash or in earning AKT tokens while learning about the platform.

  - **Unique Campaign Focus:** 
    - Unlike typical campaigns on Zealy.io that focus on social media tasks, Akash's campaign stands out by offering missions related to building on the platform.
    - Robert expressed excitement about the campaign’s future and the potential for growth within the Akash community.

  - **Call for Involvement:** 
    - Robert hinted at the possibility of expanding the team as the campaign grows, indicating that more community members could get involved in the future.

- **Kaylem's Input:**
  - **Support for Content Creation:** Kaylem expressed enthusiasm for Akash's efforts to involve more than just builders in the community. He offered to help push content creation missions to his followers and assist with sourcing articles, indicating that he has a consistent following that engages with his posts about Akash.
  - **Concerns About Overlapping Efforts:** Kaylem raised a concern about participants taking on similar tasks, such as writing multiple staking guides, which might result in redundant submissions. He suggested limiting repetitive tasks like guide creation to avoid duplication of effort and participant frustration.

- **Benjamin B's Response:**
  - **Open to Suggestions:** Benjamin encouraged Kaylem and others to suggest ideas for shaping missions that would resonate with their followers and help drive participation. He emphasized that the team is open to collaboration on creating missions that fit the community's needs.
- **Referral Mission Suggestion:**
  - A participant suggested reintroducing a referral mission to help attract new members to the Akash community.
  - Robert acknowledged the suggestion, noting that referral missions were used in a previous campaign. However, they didn't see much success, with only a few participants completing the mission.
  - He expressed openness to revisiting the idea in the second Sprint, possibly tweaking the goal numbers to make the mission more appealing and achievable.

- **- **Closing Remarks:****
  - **Content Creation Discussions:** Robert agreed with Kaylem's points and proposed having a follow-up conversation to shape content creation and social media missions. He highlighted the importance of leveraging community energy to keep the momentum going.
  - **Future Calls:** Robert mentioned that there will be two more calls this month, one next Monday and another on the 26th. He suggested that the call on the 26th could be a special working group call to review the analytics of the campaign, share the dashboard with participants, and officially close out the first Sprint.
  - **Potential Schedule Adjustment:** Depending on how things progress, the team may consider switching to bi-weekly calls instead of weekly ones.
  - Robert encouraged participants to stay engaged and provide feedback through the Akash Zealy working group channel on Discord. He emphasized the importance of community input in making the initiative successful.
  - He also reminded everyone of the other working group calls happening during the week, where participants can earn extra points.

**Next Steps:**
- **Consideration of Referral Mission:** Robert and the team may revisit the referral mission concept in the second Sprint, with adjustments based on previous experiences.
- **Community Feedback:** Participants are encouraged to continue providing feedback and suggestions to improve the campaign.
