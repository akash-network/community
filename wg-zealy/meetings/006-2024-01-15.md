### Rewards Payout Overview:
##### Robert Del Rey:
- Exporting data from Zealy provides basic information in an Excel file.
- Data includes usernames, addresses, and mission completion details.
- Noted the simplicity of the process but discovered a challenge during the second pilot extension.
#### Challenge Encountered

- Confirmed readiness to pay out rewards, acknowledging the need for improvements in future calculations.
- Robert expressed the intention to proceed with reward payouts and announced a brief announcement regarding gathering addresses from participants.
- Raised the question of whether to ask participants for addresses again or confirm existing ones before sending out rewards
- Benjamin suggested allowing participants to change their addresses if needed by DMing before payouts, but otherwise, proceeds should be sent to their provided addresses.
