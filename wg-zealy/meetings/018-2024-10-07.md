## Meeting Notes:

### Welcome and Introduction
- Robert Del Rey opened the meeting, welcoming participants and introducing the topics related to Akash Zealy's working group.
- Mentioned that this week's meeting would be shorter than usual due to fewer agenda items.  
- Introduced the main discussion points: sprint #3 updates, rewards distribution, and general Q&A.

### Sprint #3 Updates  
- Robert highlighted the launch of sprint #3, which started on October 1, 2024.  
- Sprint #3 will run for five weeks, ending on October 30.  
- Several missions are available, including deploying Akash Console, creating videos about Akash, and working with Akash Persistent Storage.  
- Content creation missions are still part of the sprint, with a focus on Akash SIGs and other initiatives.  
-  Robert emphasized the importance of participation and completing missions to earn rewards and XP.

### Rewards Distribution and Claim Process  
- Robert explained the reward payout system, specifically addressing the concerns from sprint #2.  
- Rewards are calculated after each sprint, and winners must submit their preferred AKT address to claim rewards.  
- Demonstrated the payout process using an Excel document to track eligible users, their XP, and the corresponding AKT rewards.  
- Emphasized that participants must claim their rewards before the claim window closes on **Friday, October 18, 2024**, for sprint #2.  
- For sprint #3, a mission was introduced at the start requiring participants to submit their AKT address to avoid missing the claim window.

### Mission Feedback and Content Creation Discussions  
- Benjamin B. shared positive feedback regarding a recently released mission on creating a web app. Two users provided valuable feedback immediately after the mission's release.  
- Benjamin also addressed a query regarding posting articles on Twitter instead of Medium. He noted that while Twitter is acceptable, it is preferred that the user has a strong following.  
- Robert agreed, stating that as long as the content is of high quality, it doesn't matter where it is posted. However, low-quality, AI-generated content will be rejected.  
- Discussed cooldown periods for missions. If a participant fails a mission, they can retry after a set cooldown, depending on the mission type (ranging from one week to one month).

### Updates on Working Group and Special Interest Group Calls  
- Robert reminded attendees about other working group and SIG calls happening this week, which offer opportunities to earn extra XP:  
  - Tuesday: Community Monthly Meeting  
  - Wednesday: SIG Design and SIG Economics calls  
  - Thursday: Akash Website Working Group call  
- Attendees can join these calls and participate by noting secret words announced during the sessions, allowing them to earn additional XP.

### Q&A Session  
- **Daniel Idache** asked about mission completion status and if the status remains “completed” after a sprint. **Robert** clarified that participants could not redo completed missions unless they failed them.  
- **Victor Idoko** inquired about the payout timing for sprint #2 rewards. **Robert** responded that payouts are processed in batches, and all rewards will be distributed by October 18.  
- **John Doe** asked if he could redo a mission he completed seven months ago. **Robert** and **Benjamin** explained that this mission was archived and reactivated, so users can participate again, but in general, once a mission is completed, it cannot be repeated.  

## Action Items:  
- **Robert** to review missions and process rewards for sprint #2 by October 18, 2024.  
- **Participants** to ensure their AKT addresses are submitted for sprint #3 missions to avoid missing out on rewards.  
- **All attendees** encouraged to join the upcoming working group and SIG calls for extra XP.  
- **Robert** and **Benjamin** to ensure clear communication regarding mission cooldown periods and reactivation processes.
