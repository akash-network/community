## Meeting Notes:

### Welcome and Introduction
- Robert Del Rey opened the meeting, welcoming participants and introducing the topics related to Akash Zealy's working group.
- Mentioned that this week's meeting would be shorter than usual due to fewer agenda items.  
- Introduced the main discussion points: sprint #3 updates, rewards distribution, and general Q&A.

### Sprint #3 Updates  
- Robert highlighted the launch of sprint #3, which started on October 1, 2024.  
- Sprint #3 will run for five weeks, ending on October 30.  
- Several missions are available, including deploying Akash Console, creating videos about Akash, and working with Akash Persistent Storage.  
- Content creation missions are still part of the sprint, with a focus on Akash SIGs and other initiatives.  
-  Robert emphasized the importance of participation and completing missions to earn rewards and XP.

### Rewards Distribution and Claim Process  
- Robert explained the reward payout system, specifically addressing the concerns from sprint #2.  
- Rewards are calculated after each sprint, and winners must submit their preferred AKT address to claim rewards.  
- Demonstrated the payout process using an Excel document to track eligible users, their XP, and the corresponding AKT rewards.  
- Emphasized that participants must claim their rewards before the claim window closes on **Friday, October 18, 2024**, for sprint #2.  
- For sprint #3, a mission was introduced at the start requiring participants to submit their AKT address to avoid missing the claim window.

### Mission Feedback and Content Creation Discussions  
- Benjamin B. shared positive feedback regarding a recently released mission on creating a web app. Two users provided valuable feedback immediately after the mission's release.  
- Benjamin also addressed a query regarding posting articles on Twitter instead of Medium. He noted that while Twitter is acceptable, it is preferred that the user has a strong following.  
- Robert agreed, stating that as long as the content is of high quality, it doesn't matter where it is posted. However, low-quality, AI-generated content will be rejected.  
- Discussed cooldown periods for missions. If a participant fails a mission, they can retry after a set cooldown, depending on the mission type (ranging from one week to one month).

### Updates on Working Group and Special Interest Group Calls  
- Robert reminded attendees about other working group and SIG calls happening this week, which offer opportunities to earn extra XP:  
  - Tuesday: Community Monthly Meeting  
  - Wednesday: SIG Design and SIG Economics calls  
  - Thursday: Akash Website Working Group call  
- Attendees can join these calls and participate by noting secret words announced during the sessions, allowing them to earn additional XP.

### Q&A Session  
- **Daniel Idache** asked about mission completion status and if the status remains “completed” after a sprint. **Robert** clarified that participants could not redo completed missions unless they failed them.  
- **Victor Idoko** inquired about the payout timing for sprint #2 rewards. **Robert** responded that payouts are processed in batches, and all rewards will be distributed by October 18.  
- **John Doe** asked if he could redo a mission he completed seven months ago. **Robert** and **Benjamin** explained that this mission was archived and reactivated, so users can participate again, but in general, once a mission is completed, it cannot be repeated.  

## Action Items:  
- **Robert** to review missions and process rewards for sprint #2 by October 18, 2024.  
- **Participants** to ensure their AKT addresses are submitted for sprint #3 missions to avoid missing out on rewards.  
- **All attendees** encouraged to join the upcoming working group and SIG calls for extra XP.  
- **Robert** and **Benjamin** to ensure clear communication regarding mission cooldown periods and reactivation processes.

Robert Del Rey: GM. Maya Cache CV Hunters. You doing today. I hope your weekend was So welcome to this week Akash silly working group In this call. We said about all things related to a cash silly Rewards missions, bounties ideas. And anything else that comes to mind? My name is there really and today is October the 7th. 1024.

Robert Del Rey: today's call. I guess it's gonna be shorter than usual. I don't have many topics to discuss. but if you have topics, you want to bring to the table, feel free to do so and we chat about them So, first thing I want to address was that a sprint. Number three, lunch, one week ago, it launched on October 1st. So, this is only the first week. We started getting submissions already. So thank you everybody for your eagerness in participating in this campaign, This is a sprinkle number three.

Robert Del Rey: In and we're planning on going directly and have a strength. Number four, When the time rives. but spring number three There are some missions available. I guess you're already sold them. There are missions about deploying a cash console do a video about a cash console.

Robert Del Rey: The cash provider and the cash persistent, the storage missions. Remain in this sprint. And also some content creation mission. Including the video of Akash console, which I guess mentioned in the Cash slug designer.

Robert Del Rey: Other than that, we have the Working Group and Special Interest Groups Missions, that you can join to learn more about other initiatives in a cash. And also get extra XP points. Which is great.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you everybody for joining us in the attendance today is quite big. Thank you so much for joining. If you have questions, feel free to stop Anytime, or drop them in this chat here, or in the attach the score chat, And I do our best to respond to your questions. So we love it when you come to us with questions, Moving on in the agenda. as soon as one is print ends in another sprint we start to doing the math. So, we calculate how many rewards everybody gets?

Robert Del Rey: Once we do the math, we then open up a mission. So, people can go to Sealy and claim this mission. In this case, I'm talking about claim and sprint. Number two, rewards And insure my screen here.

Robert Del Rey: That makes can you see this? And you cannot. In one second.

Robert Del Rey: You need one second, my friends. Present something else. Here we go. With a cash. Seated should be on the screen already. So I'm talking about claim a string to rewards.

Robert Del Rey: Miss Mission is very simple. Congratulations for winning. We only require you to submit your preferred Akt address. And once you submit the address, I then go use. I who submitted the address.

Robert Del Rey: This is what I do before paying their rewards. we're gonna do a live demo so you can see what's up. Because we got a lots of questions during the weekend about. When was I going to get Etc. So I guess it's better if I just show how we pay the rewards? Let me share something else again. Give me one second. This slide guys. This is life entire window.


### 00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: Let's see, it's works. All right. You should be able to see an Excel document. You should be able to find this document also in a cash silly these cortana. This is basically the winner list for the sprint. Number two, these are all the people eligible for rewards. In this column you can see the total to pay out in These are all the XP points that these guys earn. You can see. These are their username and seeley and their handle on discord. And the total akto rewards that they would get the conversion rate at the moment is 10 XP equals 18.

Robert Del Rey: So, you can see here Divided by 10. It's a total of 140.5 Akt rewards. Make sure how to do extra. This is the chance of Syria at the moment. so, basically, what I do is this I login into my computer I go to sleep. Can you see ceiling? No, apparently you cannot.

Robert Del Rey: give me one more second, guys.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, it seems I cannot share two screens at the same time.

Robert Del Rey: let's see when there is a will there is a way, right? Or let me just share the entire square. Okay, I'll find it. So I just played in my screen into so you can see better the process of paying out rewards. Than me. This is the side, right? So here are the dimension. Okay let's say I enter my act address one, two, three Akt address and I click Submit That is going to go to reduce here. As you can see here, we can see All the submissions you guys do. We review them, we approve them, we reject them. It's gonna depend on what you do. Let's go specifically to claim a sprint rewards. You see this one, it says, Claim screen reward that you see that? It was a bit quicker. Let me do it again.

Robert Del Rey: You see here? The sprint rewards, right? I click on that. so, I can see the address this person submitted Okay, it's taking a bit longer now.

Robert Del Rey: All let's go with this one. so, the first thing I confirm is that if this person earn points during a sprint, number two, So, let's go set Golden. I go to excel and

Benjamin B: Or we still cooking, we can't hear enough for the post 20 seconds.

Benjamin B: Still nothing for me, at least.

Daniel Idache: Yeah, I can hear you.

daniel ishaya: Where you from?


### 00:10:00

Benjamin B: Everyone is still here.

Daniel Idache: Certainly, they get into hello.

Benjamin B: We are just having some mike issues for Robert

Daniel Idache: Sarah Roberts, I used to that.

Daniel Idache: Okay, that's cool. Who be here with.

Robert Del Rey: Hey guys,

Benjamin B: Yes.

Robert Del Rey: All right, sorry about that. we're live guys. Things like that happen, even to the best of us. So let's move on. I will try the screen again and move on to this. But basically, that was the main example, I just shared the username on Siri. and go to the winner's list and if the person is here, which it is I just go. To the wallet and pay them 34 Akt. Which is the example. in this case, let's say Silly master. One, two, three, four. A claim. The Mission. I will go ahead and see the mission. I will copy his username or her username and try to look for it in the document.

Robert Del Rey: As you can see, it says we couldn't find anything with that. Usually? so, let's say, Benjamin You submitted your address Benjamin, so minute your address. If I come here and I don't find you, it's because you did not make a point during Sprints number two, So if you didn't make points during a strength, number two, we cannot pay you rewards for a sprint number two, I hope that's clear. that doesn't mean. That you cannot join a print. Number three and make points for a Number three. And then when the spring three ends, you can claim our rewards for the sprint. Number three, let me close this. I'm done with the example.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, I wanted to give you that quick overview about how we go about pain rewards and conserving, who earn rewards and who doesn't so guys, Yeah. that. I usually review missions every day? Yes. One. They know, depends on the traffic and the amount of missions. But let's say I've sit down in my computer. I review missions. I pay everybody who's to And then I am done and I continue with my life, right? So, if you claim rewards, After I review missions, it's possible. You will get a rewards the next time, I sit down you missions. I hope that makes sense.

Robert Del Rey: Don't worry, rewards will be paid out. Just gotta be a little patient. I guess, they claim window for this rewards and in a week. it ends next Friday, the 18th. So it's a little less than two weeks away. So you have these week in the next week to clean your rewards and we have that same time to pay you out. So, Yeah. That is what I wanted to share about claiming rewards and Payout. I will stop for a second. Hopefully anybody has a question or comment about this.

Robert Del Rey: If not that's terrifying, we can just move on in the next topic, on the agenda. Remember guys, if you still have questions, doubts, concerns the Cash CD score channel is the best place to shed about this. So yeah.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, I basically covered the most important things I wanted to cover, quick, reminder about the sprint. Number three, we started the last week. printing number three, it's gonna go all the way on to October 30th.

Robert Del Rey: This is a five week sprint, which is nice more time for you to do the missions and get more rewards. And the claim window like I just said it ends on not this Friday, the 11th. I'm talking about next Friday, the 18th. So yeah, once the clean window is closed, you won't be able to claim the rewards that you made during the sprint. Number two. All right. So don't be like, So yeah, that's what I had for. Now Benji, I wanted to give you the microwave quickly in case you wanted to give us some updates about the develop permissions or anything else in particular you want to discuss about.


### 00:15:00

Benjamin B: Sure, thank One thing I quickly wanted to mention is that I'm very thankful. We released the mission for creating the web app and we got great feedback almost instantly, I believe two different users. We also got feedback for another mission where we made a mistake and We fixed it very quickly. If you ever see something that looks to be out of place. Please just something in the zealy shot like this user thumb and we can take care of it as fast as possible. There's one mission. We wanted to discuss live One user asked if

Benjamin B: He could post the articulation on Twitter instead of medium or another blog posting platform. I would say that it's fine, but preferably if the person has a following on Twitter, What do you think?

Robert Del Rey: I prefer the poster on social media, so the following can see what they do. but,

Robert Del Rey: Honestly, I mean if they create a good piece of content that we can reuse later and maybe post it from other channels like a cash channels, I really don't mind where they post it as long as it's a good quality piece of work,

Benjamin B: I see. So the reason to why the posting on the Twitter mission was Removed that so many people who just had no quality in those missions and used AI. So, I will respond to this user saying that. As long as it's a serious effort, we're going to review it properly. Even though it's on Twitter.

Robert Del Rey: Exactly. Yeah, we're gonna still review them. That doesn't mean it's going to be a proof or rejected, I'm not saying anything, but to If we see the effort in the piece we will definitely give it a chance and review it. But yeah, hope that that is a good work For this particular case

Benjamin B: Yeah, there's one more thing I wanted to cover is that the previous prints including Springs too. We have had the mission on the claiming window. But free and onwards. Were going to have a mission at the beginning of each sprint just where you have to submit your Akt address so people don't miss the claim window.

Robert Del Rey: Yes.

Benjamin B: if you see any issues with this, if you are able to see missions with rewards without doing this, please let us know because people are not supposed to Earn XP. If they don't have an Akt address. In that mission. I will need it to Daniel, what's up?

Robert Del Rey: Daniel, if you're talking, you're muted. Or maybe you raise the hand by mistake. That's fine too.

Robert Del Rey: In the meantime, thanks for reminding me being. during forestry and onwards, there is gonna be a mission. I mean to help us save time and help you saving that the headache about these. let me show you real quickly.

Robert Del Rey: You see the joint number three mission. You're gonna click on that. And now instead of joining the screen and doing the missions, And then submitting your address by the end of the screen. We made a little change. in order to join the sprint, you need to add your Akt address. So this is going to help this campaign in two ways. First


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: We already gonna have your Akt address and assume the spring ends and we calculate the rewards. We're gonna have an address to pay you right away. Saving some time in this process. And number two is that, this is kind of like a filter. If you don't do this mission, you won't be able to see the missions available for the spring number three. So I hope that's clear, thanks for reminding me. now, Daniel, you had your hand up behind

Daniel Idache: And good afternoon, Sir Robert.

Robert Del Rey: Afternoon.

Daniel Idache: so I'm the question I want to ask ISM so for the mission, which is for one to submit the code on the zealy and call. So it's still showing completed on mine and I don't know if it's supposed to be like that after the end of every sprint if I have completed admission cancel, meeting again and that time when this and you call hoods and I get the code to going for a second, maybe for this new screen, you just started. Thank you, and John.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, the way we have set up this missions is that if you didn't once and we approve it you want to be able to do it again. but, if you did it, and you fail, You can try again after I cooldown period. Some missions is one week the waiting time in order to resume it again, but if you submit it and you win, you want to be able to do the same mission again. The simulator, the sprint. The silencer your question.

Daniel Idache: Yeah, yeah, the ghost. Thank you.

Robert Del Rey: All thank you for asking, maybe in the future. Depending on the mission. We might change this. But right now, in order to make it fair for everybody, we decided to go that route. You can do missions, only once. All right.

Robert Del Rey: let's go over some reminders then since we exhausted the agenda Remember, we have other? Working group and special interest group calls. This week, we have a bunch.

Robert Del Rey: Tomorrow Tuesday, we have the same community monthly meeting. On Wednesday, we have two calls. We have the sick design and we have seek economics. On Thursday, we have the working group or a cash website. Thanks, Benjamin for sending out the calendar. So, these four calls that are gonna happen this week, you can join them. You can learn more about other community initiatives, done in a cache and you got a chance to air extra XP points during those calls, I say a secret word and you can in that word or For prices. Sorry, for extra XP.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, at the moment, it's 10 XP didn't have each phone will give you money if you join them all. I mean, it's gonna give you 180 each each call. so a good chance of earning some extra KT. So yeah, I hope to see those spaces there. Another thing that I can quickly spoke about is that we pay out the rewards in batches,

Robert Del Rey: we pay other rewards in matches, if I sit down I will pay out all the people claiming And then I will continue with my life on that. I sit down again and recreations. So if I send an announcement in the group and I say that, the first round of rewards was paid out and you were not paid out rewards, it can be one of two things either, you did not earn points to a rewards or I haven't sat down in my computer to review the missions and pay out the rewards in any case. Please patience guys and feel free to ask in the discord channel. Anything. I see Victor as for those that haven't received their rewards for a screen when will they receive it, okay? as I'm saying,


### 00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: The clean window and in two weeks, it ends. Next Friday, the 18th. So you have until then to claim and receive your rewards. There is a little caveat here. If you did not earn points during the strength. Number two, please don't expect rewards for a sprint number. All right. I hope that answers your questions, Victor. John Doe.

Robert Del Rey: I did quest create a web app and deploy on a cash around seven months ago. Can I do it again? No. I was just saying, the missions are set up in a way that if you do them once and you win, you won't be able to do them again. if you do them and you lose or will reject them, you have a chance to try them again, some missions, let you do it after one month, some missions, let you do that after one week, and some missions that you do that after one hour. How will let me show you. Let's go here.

Robert Del Rey: One of the design working group for example, You see here. This one cool down. Don't retry. You cannot try again with this one, but let me see the fun one. For this example.

Robert Del Rey: I need to join the springs myself.

Benjamin B: robert's, I'm just going to Add something to this question.

Robert Del Rey: Let's see. for example, this one

Benjamin B: This particular mission, we had it. A long time ago, seven months ago, and we put it in archiving, and then when we put it back, it seems like the users to It can complete again. I would say all the missions that's available to you, you can try for them because this is a mistake on our end and Not that many people complete that mission. Anyways, for this mission and we're allowing people to do it again. Just because something went wrong when we tried to unarchive it. Feel free to do this mission again, but for other missions. If you complete them, you're not going to see them again and you're gonna see what Robert is explaining here.

Robert Del Rey: I mean if you are able to see the missions in the dashboard, feel free to do them. if you cannot see the missions, it's because either you already did them you cannot do that yet. So going back to the example, you're gonna see here in the missions. This is the cooldown period. So, missions the cooldown, it's one month, it's gonna depend on the nation. So yeah, I hope that point is Great question, thank you for bringing it up. And The other thing. Yeah. Yeah. Reminded about the claim window, I already said that seven times already. So let's do one last time they claim window for the screen. Number two, and on Friday.

Robert Del Rey: the Sprint number three and on October the 30th. And then it's very possible that we start a sprint number four in November. So I spread the word invite your friends and Yeah let's make it happen So that's all I have for today is called. I already exhausted the agenda. I don't know. Benjamin if there's anything else you want to bring to the table or any of you.

Robert Del Rey: Cost of the secret word, John for Seeley. It's a cloud. The cloud Big E C L O, u D, That's the secret For this particular call each working group call has a different word, So make sure to join those calls to figure out. What is that word? All right, This is valid for people listening now and also people listening to the record So yeah, yeah, that's that. But yeah, my friends with that being said, I see one head up. Go ahead, Daniel.


### 00:30:00

Daniel Idache: Service are robots. Can you like he was the coding and…
