Robert Del Rey: All right, guys. Hello and Happy Monday. I'm not counting the calls. But if I'm correct, this should be the third silly call, right? Yeah, the Federal.

Scott Hewitson: Heard that I've been on.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, I mean to Me too. hopefully more people can join this cold over time. Luckily. We're recording the call for that one to see it later. much Tyler. Thank you guys for joining. So the agenda I have for today. it's gonna go over the questions. We have got in the shed about the Sealy campaign some posting on social media and groups sharing will update you how that went. And how will I continue with that and also some questions about Mission reviewing and abuse? So if you guys do you have any other item you want to add to the agenda? or place called

Scott Hewitson: I think I'm Sounds good to me.

Benjamin B: I have one thing because of the George not wanting to get part of the pilot anymore and…

Robert Del Rey: go go.

Benjamin B: we decided on having this as a conversation on what to use those funds were

Robert Del Rey: You got it. Thanks.

Scott Hewitson: 

Scott Hewitson: Yeah, I mean, I think if George isn't gonna be involved or does he doesn't have the bandwidth that's working on other things. I think we've originally talked about it like 2500 and then 250 to the three of you all and the rest go to rewards so just say Throw George's to Rewards.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah for…

Scott Hewitson: and then there's no issues.

Robert Del Rey: that's a good fix. So more rewards for people.

Scott Hewitson: Is that sound reasonable Benji?

Benjamin B: Yeah, that was one of the things mean Robert agreed on. When writing about it that we would be fine with that.

Scott Hewitson: Perfect. Okay.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, we're that call me but it's fine. We're gonna push forward. That's what we do here on a cash, especially in silly working group. So guys about the shots I was saying before I was so happy to see all the comments. I got a few Retweet some likes on social media, which was really nice on the silly discogroup. Sadly, I didn't get any feedback people react to the post by then receive any textual feedback. So what I will do is that on. Wednesday I will go ahead and do another round of sharing I'm gonna go ahead and share again of social media and share again in the city groups. And also I cash this Korean cash Telegram

Robert Del Rey: Speaking of Akash this current telegram. Yeah, that is where most of the questions came from which is totally understandable. We share it for the group first insiders, then the broader community. And I believe the most common question is regarding the rewards it seems that people got the understanding that. They would do the missions and claim the rewards right away. So I mean if the first thing I did this morning was clarifying that you should just do the missions and the rewards are going to be paid out.

Robert Del Rey: On December 21st, which is one week after we run The Silicon paint is gonna run from its running from last Friday was first. It's gonna run until Friday the 15th. So it's a two week pilot. So one week after that until the 21st or 22nd. We're gonna go ahead and start paying out those Rewards.

Robert Del Rey: and I believe I answered that. So the question I have is how maybe we can go ahead and make sure this is clear for next iterations one idea. I have a monies that we can go ahead and compile the most asked questions or all the questions that they ask and maybe select the top five most common questions and add that somewhere where people can see that. But that's something I got right away off my mind. I don't know what you guys think about this so far.

00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: Go ahead Scott.

Scott Hewitson: Yes, so something I'll just say in general anytime like, members of overclock or whatever we've done stuff in the past where people are getting rewards. You're always gonna have people like whatever words remember words. So, it's a good thing like people are doing it again, but you don't feel the pressure to speed things up based off of external inputs. You got a game plan, I think we stick with it. And yeah, I mean anyone who's whining about it or whatever. Those aren't necessarily the people. We want to stick around anyway, so I'm not overly concerned. Just from a high level.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, man.

Scott Hewitson: So I still think that thank you guys are doing a great job.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks, I think you're right about that.

Scott Hewitson: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, we also said that dates. So we're gonna just stick to those imagine if we break that for any people in the group, then everybody's gonna feel entitled. So yeah,…

Scott Hewitson: 100%

Robert Del Rey: I agree with you 100% of Scott and anyone else. maybe when I don't have some questions for you Benjamin, but that's in a moment because I don't want you to expand on that but it's basically on how you feel about reviewing the missions. We're gonna go over that in a moment. I just believe that is what it's gonna take the most Of our call so that's why I'm going to leave those for the last part.

Robert Del Rey: But yeah, what was other question as so but yeah, the mainly one was in regards to the rewards. So we made sure that it's a specific now before going over reviewing the missions. I want to show you something guys. Let me go ahead and share my screen. Right now sorry Tyler. I'm gonna take over you. But I hope you can understand. So here's the silly Bachelor We No One Love. Let me know if you can see it. Awesome.

Scott Hewitson: Yep, I can see it.

Robert Del Rey: So you can see the first mission is open for everybody doesn't pay out akt gives you 100 XP points. And the rest of the missions are locked until you do this one single Mission. So if I do this one single Mission people

Robert Del Rey: will have access to do any of the missions here. the one from osmosis and the one for the cash EDU. I on published them. So they're not published. That's why they're grayed out. I didn't believe them but they are unpublished. Nobody can see them. So the reason why I did that is because Adam told me about the issues signing up with the cash in you. He's kind of working that I truly understand him. He has a lot in his plate so I don't judge him at all.

Robert Del Rey: and yeah, I decided to unpublish this Mission they get to know greater Mission. This one didn't pay out any akt, but yeah, I didn't want to add work to what Adam is doing, people have to request access to this and maybe we're gonna have this one For another season I guess but yeah, as I was saying all the missions are locked onto you don't do this Mission. You cannot do these missions. I'm sure that already. One user can do the missions only once as you can see here, they can do the emissions only once so, let's say I do this Mission. I created my own as the L using cloudmose. I submitted when you review it. He accepted. And I got 100 XP and I got 10 akt.

Robert Del Rey: Where can we see this information? If we go to the leaderboard on the left side of the screen. You can see all the people participate in missions. This is current but also got people from the past these two here if I'm not mistaken, but these guys participate in this guy is current these are kind of new users that we had so far kinda around 11 users. So let's say we're going to see how many missions Hitachi did. Or it's easier to pronounce against Pablo. He did request you can see that and he has cumulated 300 XP points. If I click on Pablo. We can see in more detail. We can see his Discord user.

00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: So we can confirm his identity and we can also see his Twitter account. If you want to open up a silly profile, you have to connect either one of these two or the two accounts you're But there's no way to have access to this without connecting a Discord or paragraph. Sorry or Twitter account. below here, it's the missions they did.

Robert Del Rey: As you can see the guys have done three missions so far. So this is my proposal and I'm gonna drop this in the chat. I want to hear your thoughts and specifically you been using your day one. There is taking the lead reviewing the missions and correcting and giving the points. How would you feel about reviewing the missions in a proven them? And then use the leaderboard. So that we can see how many rewards we have to pay out instead of Hitachi did one mission is instead of going a mission by Mission and having a sheet like login the rewards you got to pay out.

Robert Del Rey: Since everything is together here. I would suggest that we could wait until all the missions are reviewed and then based on the leaderboard we can go ahead and pay it out the required. I just believe it's gonna be easier if we do it that way as you can see we're gonna also export this to an Excel file. But yeah, that are basically the options on reviewing the missions and paying out the rewards. So yeah, I'll leave it to you guys. how would you feel about using the leaderboard to pay out the Rewards or have you thought about any other way of reviewing and paying out these Rewards?

Benjamin B: And not reviews. It's not needed and the analytics members and automations. I believe without more maybe.

Robert Del Rey: Absolutely sadly Analytics is not available or a while I mean since

Robert Del Rey: when we first started this it asked us to sign up for the waitlist, and I haven't got any emails about it. I don't know if people got access to it yet, but it's planning to launch monthly subscriptions. So people can see more information. But yeah analytic is not available some beta testers in the CD score group have access to it. But yeah, we don't just so guys, so it's gonna be a bit challenging knowing the analytics. I believe it's gonna be nice seeing them, but I will see what I can do about automations then

Robert Del Rey: This one is really good. For example, let's say if we want to have a specific channel on this score and the only way to access that is be a silly role in your profile. For that we will need to connect a cache Discord to see we need admin rights to do that or an administrator or a cash Discord can go ahead and do that. Let me do a quick demo. I guess if I go here it says you need an information to what the silly but to the server. So yeah, let's add the permission whatever.

Robert Del Rey: It's gonna ask me for the permissions. Can you guys see what I'm seeing now?

Scott Hewitson: Yep.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you. So, yeah, it's gonna ask you for permissions connect the board whatever but since I don't have access to a cash. Discord as an admin. I cannot add the silly button and that's why we don't have a specific channel that only silly people can see for now. I think it's not needed. Because we have the silly working group channel in Discord, but maybe that's something we can consider in the future when this is an official Community program, I guess but yeah, that's what you do in this automation tab. there is another way to access this you can go ahead and click on the three dots go on And from settings you go to Integrations. That's the same that is the automation step.

00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: But yeah, then after that is just general settings so yeah. I hope that covers your question Ben you

Benjamin B: Yeah, there's one more thing. What happens if you click members. I'm trying to see if there's a good way to see how much ATT each member should have the way you proposed seems really consuming for no apparent reason

Robert Del Rey: German let's find a way. This is the member stop I can import members. download that into an Excel file. Yeah, I remember Sorry, You can download this into an Excel file. You will be able to see. This information. I guess this is the formula. Let's do a try now. I'm downloading. Let's see.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, that did nothing.

Benjamin B: Maybe don't show it in front of everyone.

Robert Del Rey: No worries.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, let me close this. Yeah. Maybe I can explore these further. But when you click on upgrade plan, I told you with the analytics to join the waiting list again, I join a few months and I didn't got an email. I guess I would just go ahead and write up my email again. So to see maybe we have a better luck this time. But yeah, that's how it is and analytics and members the review ones.

Benjamin B: I have yeah.

Robert Del Rey: I believe you have access to see the review Once since you have already. review submissions and inbox here. This is more for the admin side. I don't know if you can see that bendy. Let me know if you cannot so I can add you. But yeah, I believe only admins can see that.

Benjamin B: again

Robert Del Rey: and this is for notifications when someone joins organizations someone joins the

Robert Del Rey: the quest whatever. But yeah. You have another question about the platform. I'm more than happy to chat with anybody about it. But going back to the question I guess what other things could make your work easier in review emissions because I understand it can be very consuming. So I'm only years Let me know how this would be easier and better and stronger for you.

Benjamin B: I don't think the review process takes that long. It's just open the link and see whether or not it's valid or you see the emotion you see if it's valid or not. When you already have the knowledge, it doesn't take that long. However, When tracking everything and knowing how much we owe to the users and how much to pay out. I think that's another thing so the one more the question I have now is that if we were to change it like XP, could we track how much to pay out the adults? because I think Let me see if we have.

Benjamin B: What is about 1080p? and we give it to let's say an average of

Benjamin B: things to make it different person. We would have to go through almost seven three. Users just seeing what they've done or not.

Robert Del Rey: I get it something a range for example, if you get between 500 XP to 200 XP you will get 25kt. For example if you get from 1,080 to 2018, you will get 180. I just made up the numbers but is that something similar to what you have in mind?

Benjamin B: what you could do is that you could give XP based of the number of apis who may be 10 XP per 180 or something and then payout together, but then you have the old XP and it's not certain whether or not the old XP the current leaderboard will be changed. Yes, because you changed missions. I think we have to look into this a bit more but the only other solution that I think makes sense is automating The leaderboard so if we were to export it put it in Excel, but I think that's a lot of effort for something that could be. Sold probably not much easier way.

00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: Guided men absolutely. Yeah, Let's talk more about this. That's what grade level about this pilot. We're just testing out and any straight that we can go ahead and test trial error and then refine and do it better. and yeah, this is great. I'm learning so much after we launch this that is crazy. So just to recap I really forget your idea right now Let's say for example instead of having five 10 akt and 10 akt Maybe it could be only in based on the XP we can do a conversion.

Robert Del Rey: Maybe 10 XP equals one akt and based on that XP that you accumulate right? You will get akt. it is that similar to

Benjamin B: Yeah, This is almost correct. You could still have the akt number displayed to them. But because we can't see it. We have to understand how much we should give them.

Robert Del Rey: Got it guide.

Benjamin B: So I would say keep both but change the XP to be holy say it linear to the amount of akt.

Robert Del Rey: No, the other question you had is if the leaderboard changes if we change.

Robert Del Rey: Is on the mission? And we're gonna find out now life, but you guys say I do it? I will go ahead and…

Benjamin B: Yes.

Robert Del Rey: change this one. the axis Let's see. Chicha, he has 400 XP.

Robert Del Rey: He did the first mission. He got a hundred XP out of that. Let's update that mission now. Let's see what happens. I'm excited.

Robert Del Rey: Let's Play five XP. All right.

Robert Del Rey: Just to change the number. Let's go to leaderboard again. And it didn't change Can you see here still has 400 XP?

Scott Hewitson: Might refresh the app or something. I mean it changed somewhere might not reflect…

Robert Del Rey: then

Scott Hewitson: until you.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, let's do that. There's nothing a refresh can't fix. All right. Let's try again.

Scott Hewitson: 

Robert Del Rey: I will close the tab altogether. It's a good sign so you can see how bad I am. I'm a close-up together and open up again.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, I will share the screen again. I haven't seen anything yet.

Robert Del Rey: I'm sharing now. Let me know if you guys can see it.

Robert Del Rey: You guys see my screen.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I'm guessing this does not work though.

Robert Del Rey: Let's see. this is a little more. yeah. No, okay. It seems like it doesn't work out because you know why because this is Yeah,…

Benjamin B: Already given to them.

Robert Del Rey: besides it's for life. since they join our city. This is how much they have done since they join our city. we can do is that we can go ahead and create a Sprint. If you go here clear strength, I can set up the duration and that's your update the number. Let's try that. So we started is still on Friday first the XP was the same so I don't know. how can we go about this? But yeah. And date. Yes, it's gonna last two weeks.

Robert Del Rey: So you can see we'll do current and Sprint now. No one is in the leaderboard yet. Because I just started the Sprint. so maybe One thing we could do is ask people to do that again, maybe and we start from zero because again, this is something I didn't consider. So it's this point.

Benjamin B: I don't think we can make everyone redo everything.

Robert Del Rey: It's for life.

Benjamin B: I would say a better solution is. and just going through exporting the leaderboard down the trying to figure out the adapt. It's not impossible. But it's not preferable leader.

00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, I really think it's gonna come down to that at the end. But it's still the good thing is that we have the knowledge for So next time we can make sure that we start the Sprint before letting people know. Hey, you can start doing the missions. Does that sound fair?

Scott Hewitson: Sounds good to me. I mean and…

Benjamin B: Robert

Scott Hewitson: it's a pilot, So we learning you said it Robert we're learning things. We're trying things, it's all about just improving on it. So I'm fine with all this.

Robert Del Rey: Absolutely. Thanks, Scott. Go ahead Benny.

Benjamin B: If you could send me the CSV file from the leaderboard, I could take a look if it's possible to automate it in a simple way. And then we could keep the XP the same.

Robert Del Rey: Sure.

Robert Del Rey: I'll go ahead and stop sharing the screen. And we export.

Robert Del Rey: So it gives me two options to export they give me all time numbers and the numbers from the Sprint I use that so I'll go ahead and go with all time for you so you can see all the information. Okay?

Benjamin B: Yeah, sounds good.

Robert Del Rey: awesome, and yeah, that. I don't have any other agenda items. I basically cover most what I wanted to cover if there's anything else you guys want to cover now, this is the perfect time.

Scott Hewitson: The only thing so on the very first mission to join a cautious Discord, if you have questions, maybe we could be more specific and join Akash and then the working group zealy channel for questions. because we have a ton of channels and Akash, and I know some people I've talked to people in the past it's just too much going on so

Robert Del Rey: A bigger one. Thanks, That's super important because It's true. And I also saw many questions in the general chat. So yeah great cash escort Discord description to be more expensive. so people can go to silly working group to ask questions specifically. Thanks Scott. And let's do a quick commercial break, right? I see George in the audience. Welcome George and also see a new face Daniel. I don't know if it's a new face. Honestly. I don't know if you were in previous calls, but welcome both if you have anything to say just come to the stage. This is open.

Robert Del Rey: In any case guys, so I got a few deliverables Benjamin. I will send you the CVS file. Like I said, I will update the discourse descriptions to make sure people can see that they can go to their cash CD working group Discord Channel. I also shared with you the plans on sharing the silly pilot on their cache these score in the cash Telegram and the silly group again and on social media again, I would share them one day not and yeah, hopefully we can get even more people to participate.

Robert Del Rey: I also made some clarifications on the telegram chat. I said that we had a price full of 1,000 for incentives those of you that know know that this is not the correct amount. it's a little more than that, right, but I just wanted to say that number.

Robert Del Rey: Just in case. I don't know. I just saw that we could use that later to our advantage hey, we run out of numbers, but we got five hundred dollars more in incentives. So yeah, I mean if we have to do that I'm not saying that we will do that. But you guys know what's the correct number we have for incentives the budget was initially to those. No total was 2500. So

00:30:00

Robert Del Rey: 750 was for payment George you were not here when we were discussing about this. We honestly are not sure if you have enough bandwidth to continue with this project. So I guess that for the pilot me and Ben you're going to continue and maybe you can join us in other silicon paints. So having said that $500 will go for payments. So 2000 will be for incentives in their cash machines. If I didn't get that right, maybe Benji, you can give me the correct numbers. Please forgive me from if I have the numbers. But yeah, it's a rough estimate.

Robert Del Rey: I just clear out that in the group that we have a price pool. So I guess that when we run out of money in the pool, I guess we will run out of prices for participants. So I guess the best way to go over that is just that letting people know that first serve until the last one is serve. Maybe you have any suggestions on how to go around this Scott scenes. You have go with boy getting stuff or maybe when you have an idea or anything else in this call. If you have a suggestion on how to go around the price cap that we have.

Scott Hewitson: Benjamin did you have anything or? I can.

Benjamin B: No, I don't have anything really on that topic,…

Scott Hewitson: I can jump in okay.

Benjamin B: but I can say no that I'm unmute that I sent the correct numbers in the shot.

Scott Hewitson: I think just how I'm thinking about it, the payments for support to you to Robert and Benji was 250 USD.

Scott Hewitson: You guys can I mean in my mind if you pay yourself out now, I mean, we're kind of along far enough where it's like right you're not just taking the money and running. I mean, I think it's fine. If you pay yourself out the dollar denominated and then we have an actual akt amount moving forward then you can track to that exactly.

Benjamin B: What mean Robert did as soon as he sent the money was to create a fraction of 250 is 10% of the total? so this is the number we've been calculating internally.

Robert Del Rey: No Thanks I will go ahead and after this call right now. I will just run the number make it to 50 and send out the payments because I believe we don't mix that with the incentives. So yeah Benjamin, I initially spoke about this. We actually didn't mind. if we didn't pay ourselves until the last day, but I believe that it's good if we don't have that money mix out in my opinion which Goes with your opinion and…

Scott Hewitson: Yeah. I think it's difficult when we have a …

Robert Del Rey: Scott, right?

Scott Hewitson: a token that changes and it swings 20% one day down 20, it's craziness. So the only thing for sure is like when something's paid at spot price that day, it has that amount whether you decide to hold it or sell it or whatever that's on the person but I've found just from all the other things I've supported. It's just easier that way. But yeah, I mean honestly however you guys would like to do it. I don't have strong opinions. Either way. That's just I guess it's an opinion. It's not a directive. So, however, you guys think you can do it the best I got complete faith complete trust in you guys.

Robert Del Rey: Appreciate it Go bendy.

Benjamin B: Yeah, so if it is okay, I think that what we created with our budgets initially. I think that's the one we should go by and both the rewards and the payouts will be based in akt done.

Benjamin B: We have a message in the shot, by the way.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, Mr. Daniel. Let me go ahead and read this.

Robert Del Rey: he's dasher. Okay, you dust yourself, man. No worries.
