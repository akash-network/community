# **Transcript**

Robert Del Rey: All right, recording and transcript in progress. So everyone. Hello and welcome to this iteration of The Cash Development Boarding program on Seeley Today, September the 9th. 2024. And it's The second week of the sprint. Number two, if I'm the mistaken. so today in this call we're gonna have a wide range of topics. We're going to start with one Of the things that people been waiting the most. It's about the required for The sprint number one ended. On August the 30th. Yeah. Benjamin, I did the math, we calculated the rewards and we're ready to paint them out. so,

Robert Del Rey: how people will be able to claim? The rewards is going to be similar to the last time. let me share my screen real quick, so you can Half a better idea.

Robert Del Rey: One sec.

Robert Del Rey: I believe this is the correct one.

Robert Del Rey: So you can see here, this is The claim a Number one rewards mission, we'll start by congratulating all the people participating in Sprint. And it's gonna work Really simple as it says here, please submit your preferred AP address in this mission to receive your rewards. So you're gonna scroll down a little You're gonna see this text box here. And in here, You're gonna add The akit the address where you want to get. Your akd rewards. If you earn rewards.

Robert Del Rey: How the Process Works, Again, It's really simple after you submit your address. Benji. And I in the back end, we match to confirm. If you earn enough points to get the rewards in, we're gonna pay those rewards. If you didn't get any points, we're gonna leave you a comments. Letting you know that no rewards earn. so, that's how it works. It's really simple. So, It's gonna be the same for each separate screen when it's print, number two ends, we're gonna calculate the rewards and we're gonna have a claim as spring Number two, rewards mission and with a sprint number three, it's gonna be the same.

Robert Del Rey: So again, you submit your prefer apt address in this mission to receive your rewards, they claim window. It's gonna be open from today, on to the 23rd. So it's gonna be two weeks for you to playing your rewards. As soon as this call ends, we're gonna drop an announcement in the CD channel. To let everybody know that this mission is open. For everybody to claim their reports. So yeah, that's that on the Plane a sprint. Number one rewards decision. I will stop real quick. In case, anybody has a questions for comments.

Robert Del Rey: If not that suddenly fine. Remember you can drop any thoughts feedbacks in the shelf here or in the shed in a cache, the score? So moving on, let's do a week a screened to update. The screen. Number two, then kickoff on September, the 2nd on Monday last week. We open up. five six new missions. That are together with the current conditions that we had in the sprint. Number one, so,

Robert Del Rey: I would go over the emissions now so you can have an idea but we have available. Let me share my screen again. Your life.

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Robert Del Rey: It should be sharing this is exciting part. so guys for the screen, number two, we open up


### 00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: a content creation missions. There are also building on a cache missions And also more missions to get involved with the Akash community. For example, this one, it's for the graphic designers and specifically, it's called the Akash Swag Designer. We are actually looking for people to Design the next generation of a cash swag. This is one example that Dennis did a while ago. Just feel free to do. Whatever you think it's gonna be appealing? things that you believe people would like to work as in a cash community member Things about cloud censorship Decentralization. Right. The A cash unit.

Robert Del Rey: we got some guide and requirements as in all the missions to help you a little to do this mission. It says Create uniquely signs. Keep in mind, their regular trademarks and logos and brand elements. if you're gonna do something with a cash logo, make sure it's something legit and doesn't hurt people feelings. Basically. So, let me believe that. There. Working. No worries.

Robert Del Rey: Below here. You have some resources in this link, you're gonna click and you're gonna go to a Cash web page where you can download all the cash network In different colors, formats light dark things. Just so that link. It's right there in the mission. There we go. It's gonna be 15 Akt to the 10. Best designs. And the best designs could be featured in the cash flow. For those of you that don't know their cash shop, Here, we got some merch shop, or a cash do network. Everyday is called. Here we got some merch for the community. Part of myself, some T-shirts from here. Okay, I didn't notice this before this mug. But yeah.

Robert Del Rey: the best designs could get featured here. They long-term goal of these is having people from the community submitting designs, and if those designs sale, for example, is possible that you could get part of that. Product. Extreme going from here, but that's something that needs to be discuss later. It's a little alpha for you guys. That's the plan that we have with this store. Want to expand that include more designs from the community. And of course, reward the cash community, So yeah, that's the attached to design mission. it's already available for you, just

Robert Del Rey: The next mission is. A.

Robert Del Rey: Big attendance today. Thank you all for joining again. And those listening to the recording later. The other mission is about deploying and host your own website on a cash. It doesn't matter what's the website about, just don't break the rules. Make sure you upload something valuable, I said before, something that doesn't hurt other people's feelings. So yeah deploying host. Your own website on a cash can be your portfolio. It can be a personal blog generate there are some great examples here. Some templates that you can get inspiration from. Please don't copy them exactly as they are. Try to add your own personal touch and deploy your stuff on the cash at the end. That this is what we want.

Robert Del Rey: We want people to learn how to deploy on a cash to see to understand how easy it is actually to have your stuff on a cache. So that's the main objective of these missions. it's already available for Just and deploy flocksnell model on a cache. It's already been playing four times out of 10. so yeah guys, hurry up, there is just a penny There are only 10 spots to claim these missions. Most of the missions have a limit on how many people can claim them. So Maria. Again, you're gonna have examples here, you can actually copy the model.


### 00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: and go from there. These are all the instructions guys. We put a lot of thought and effort to make sure this is super clear for people doing this. But again, we are not perfect, you are not perfect. In case you have doubts or questions, do not hesitate in, sending a message in a cache Esport. That's why we have that channel. Besides leaving, you updates that channel also is for helping you completely these missions. we do want you to complete all these missions. I joined this and I couldn't complete animations. We don't want that. We want people to join this and complete as many missions as they can. and we got a budget, the proposal pass

Robert Del Rey: we got a few weeks there that we want this triggered to the most prominent participants so This is here for you guys. Do it. And if you have questions, any don't hesitate in asking? So yeah, those are three missions I share with you. They are actually the three more missions that you need to find out in the dashboard. I just don't want to take too much time. But yeah, this is what we got for Again remember to ask questions, let me close out this one it's already available. Like I said this one is already available. The slug design is already available. yeah. And this was another one. Yeah, I remember now. I said before we open up Three new content, creation missions.

Robert Del Rey: People were saying that they were not enough options for them to do content. So we made up some content creation emissions for you. this one is the cash thread or, you create on a cash thread on Twitter Shared that these are some of the topics you can get inspiration from, but feel free to improvise. I mean if you have a good thesis about a cash, Are really valuable piece of content. You believe the community will benefit share it. We are eager to see what you create. So yeah, some are those examples. Again you have some requirements. Also if it's a thread, it has to include at least five tweets, talking about a cash. You must mention a cash, right?

Robert Del Rey: And yeah, you can use that are related to a cash on other projects. these one I want to emphasize in this one, a little guys. We appreciate all the submissions that we get Bailey and I actually reviewed them.

Robert Del Rey: And what I wanted to say is that Some of the submissions we get. You can see that the person didn't put any effort in them, it's just like a straight-up coffee and paste or they just asked Shad DVD, What is a cash, and your scorpion things, So guys we are on top of that. We are actually very very on top of that. So those submissions that are low quality. They are rejected, we don't spend too much time thinking about them. So please don't waste your time and energy. if you're gonna do this anyway, try to do it, right?

Robert Del Rey: There are some words that we've seen in the past and what Benjamin and I do is that we reach out to the writers and try to give them feedbacks, maybe in hopes to make their content a little bit more valuable. We provide them with links, we provide them with resources. We provide them with more nuances about a cash. and after they edit the article in recent meet, we have prove them because We want to see the effort. They want to make sure the information. It's accurate, and it's valuable. So yeah.

Robert Del Rey: That's one thing I wanted to say. Everybody's welcome to ask questions at any time by the way that is totally right. And you, thank you so much for the reminder, feel free to ask your questions. It doesn't have to be here. Again, you can send me or Benji at the end or you can just send a message in that case or channel. And Trigly make your content engaging and easy to read, right?


### 00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: One thing I do is that sometimes I open up crypto Twitter, usually, the first post that you see are post with big engagements, big reactions. So try to read those posts and analyze those posts and They got what information? They added there. That people resonated with and make them engaged with your content. one change that we had here, is that To submit your threat, you had to connect your Twitter. So privacy concerns were raised to us and we decided to change that. Now, instead of connecting your Twitter to submit, you just need to add a link to your post another here. Let's go to Twitter real quickly, right?

Robert Del Rey: I love Twitter and I don't know about you. So this is my Twitter. Let's say this is my submission. I did this. Copy link to tweet. you go to the text box here, you add the link, and then you claim I won't click on here because, I cannot participate in the sprint but this is just giving you an idea on how it works now. Before you had to connect your Twitter, you do not need to connect your Twitter, you just need to add a link to your post and that is gonna be enough for us. So yeah, that's that on the content missions. We have the cash video. You need to do a video about That is one. And their cash flow designer. Yeah, those are the three new content creation missions.

Robert Del Rey: Akashi, the video a cash threader on X. And their cash swag designer. So yeah, I've been talking for a while now and let me stop real quick. In case you guys have any questions, let me catch a brief real quick.

Robert Del Rey: It's not again the group is always open for you guys. And a spring number two is going really cool. So far at the moment, there are 20 people participating. Let me correct that at the moment, we have 20 people who earn points.

Robert Del Rey: But more than those are participated and I will tell you that in a second. So you understand better. One thing I wanted to show you is the project close out report. This is for the month number one. Actually, in here, we have more information about how the campaign went For the project. And you're gonna have more numbers here. This is what I'm talking about. On the strength. Number one, for example, we have 50 participants in total. With 38 new members.

Robert Del Rey: But let me tell you, it's not that only 50 people participating, in fact, 86 people joined the strings number one.

Robert Del Rey: Both only 50 earn points. Hence, they will get rewards out of those 50. 38 are new members to the community. Hope that makes sense. so the point that I was trying to give earlier is that even though we have 20 people in the sprint, number two right now, it can be more than that, but unless they earn points they want appear in the sprint list that I show you earlier. So more accomplishments on this campaign, we launch with 17 missions available for everybody. There were 200 planes. and in average, Every participant playing for missions in average.

Robert Del Rey: So that is an increase because in the last campaign, the average was three claims average for user. So that means that more people are doing more missions this time which is great. as you can see that the report is almost done. I'm missing. Two key pieces of information. this one is solved. We already did the math and the rewards will be paid out. Again, for those of you that didn't that join recently, as soon as it's called ends, we're gonna release a mission for you so you can claim your rewards. so yeah, it's called


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: About the PRS. Yeah, let me talk about that earlier. And let me talk with excels, Let's go to the passion that will work site decide, and love, right? if we go here to the Community tab, you're gonna find a path called Community Contributions.

Robert Del Rey: So in the community contribution staff, you can see contributions made by community members.

Robert Del Rey: When we release this initially, we wanted more people to add everything that they did on a cache light content like video content or reading guide Deployments github repos. You name it. So What we want to do in this campaign is we want to make participants to create a PR people, so they can add their bills here, it will be awesome. If you can do that, we are considering actually giving some extra rewards for the people, doing the full requests in a casket.

Robert Del Rey: So let me walk you through with real quickly if you want to submit your content or if you deployed something on a cache and you have a repo with all the information and you want to add these in the community contributions For the future generations. Using to come to this page, click on the plus sign. You're gonna have some guidelines here. Please read them. And to You go here. Create pull requests. You're gonna click the link. It's gonna open on Github. With more instructions. About how to train your full requests. So yeah.

Robert Del Rey: One of the reasons that we believe that these leading key cost is that the process can be a little bit tedious. If I may say that so, Let's do this together. If you want something that you want to upload into a cash github, you want to do a pull request? Let's do it together. That way, we can review that you meet the guidelines and we can follow the whole process. So yeah, long story short, since we're getting people building on a cash through ceiling, we want to drive some of that traffic. We want to break them on to A community contribution step and hopefully yeah, we can fill it up with more contributions as you can see. At the moment, all of them are only buy. Ing.

Robert Del Rey: So, yeah, we want some priority here. We want to see some deployments. We want to see the things you have done in Syria. we want to see them here. so yeah. Again, we're considering giving some extra Akt rewards for the first people who do this. So yeah, please do this opals out. So, yeah, some nursing some lessons that we learn. In these sprint, we managed to get more feedback from various participants and also we redesigned some of the missions in the first three months campaign. We didn't get much feedback. we got a few bothering, we didn't get, so however, in this first month,

Robert Del Rey: I'm confident to say that we got more feedback and more engagement than the three months of the last campaign, which for me is amazing. I love to see the engagement. I mean, every time I join discord I joined this for every day and at least, once I get either at the end, or there is a message in the Cash Please group, which is awesome. Yeah. There are some submissions that really extend out and we are gathering them. Let me show you on 10 submissions. I'm guides guys. I'm full of documentations in time. We want to publish this so people can have this reference. But yeah, out of all the submissions that we're getting

Robert Del Rey: We are trying to archive the best of the best. So yeah.


### 00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: That's why I say guys, if you're gonna do the effort, go all in Because if you get feature here, you're gonna get extra akat rewards. That's the reason why we're doing this, we are archiving the the bestest. And at the end of the campaign, we're gonna give extra activity rewards to the authors of these articles and guides guys. And yeah, that's that. And we also improve on the communications, on the previous campaigns, we may be sent one or two messages a week. But now in this campaign, we're sending three messages or more in the discord shot and also in Twitter.

Robert Del Rey: And the reason we're doing that is, to continually remind people that we have these available for them. Hopefully, new eyes can come across this campaign enjoying and know a cash. So that is a big improvement, compared to the previous campaign. We are communicating a lot. We are making lots of documentation, so everything is clear for you and for the people in the future seeing this. And I'm very actually very, very happy About how things are going at the moment.

Robert Del Rey: What went wrong? maybe you can help me out. Randy here. I don't know. I believe I spoke a lot already. Maybe I don't know if you can think about anything else that way. or maybe you want to add to the things that you believe that you go that things that went wrong. What you say?

Benjamin B: I think we did went really good. Some of the missions didn't end up making sense the posting your own RPC node like the creative prosperity mode. The issue there is These missions. I think we shouldn't have them be as long term. We should just make people do something and not have to commit more than a week. At most. So, if they want to have Or for some cases for hosting the Mainnet website, amongst be fine, but doing something larger for a long period of time,…

Robert Del Rey: Okay, that sounds good.

Benjamin B: takes a lot of effort.

Robert Del Rey: So you believe that If you're gonna have missions,…

Benjamin B: I don't think we should have that in the scope of healing.

Robert Del Rey: they shouldn't be longer than one week to prove that they did it, right?

Benjamin B: Yeah, I think we should keep the missions. they don't have to be super small, people can still spend the day or two onions, creating them or even more if they'd like to But we shouldn't make them actively work on it for a super long time, especially if it's not guaranteed that they will receive a price.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, I believe I understand better Yeah, absolutely. We got a rebalance, the effort in the time it takes and also the resources. because again, if you have a deployment and stuff, And the deployment is running for a few weeks. Maybe if you get the required it's not gonna be as big of a reward. If you spend 2880 in an employment, for example, There was a hand recently believe. I don't know. Who is what was but feel free to jump into the discussion.

Robert Del Rey: All right, maybe that was funny stage. All right. Thanks Maybe we can shut a little more about that offline but I do agree 100% with you. There has to be a balance between the effort that people do. How much resources they have to spend on a cash? And ultimately how much rewards they get after they would be effort. So, yeah, I mean, 100%, Yeah, I will add that.

Robert Del Rey: The next step in feature, considerations, What can I say, guys? We're gonna continue working. Bringing New Missions for You To make sure the community keeps engaged. We're gonna continue the communications I was saying We're gonna bring missions. Yeah. When the screen number two ends, we're gonna do a similar report for When the three months, and we're gonna do a similar report for you. And here we have some documentation about the projects here. you can see the things we are supposed to do with ceiling and what we're not supposed to do.


### 00:30:00

Robert Del Rey: Here, you're gonna see the project shutter in this chart. You're gonna find the thoughts and nuances that we did. When we were coming up with this campaign. As you can see, this is from July 22nd. So everything is here like the things we want to do, why we're doing this. It's to incentivize direct contributions to a cash, increase community involvement, as education, creating valuable content. That's why I emphasize so much invaluable because it's one of the reasons why work. So yeah, that's the project charter. This is the status report. This one is about the things that tasks we're doing on a cache.

Robert Del Rey: For the missions. We have launch expanding the campaign, increase the community by 300 new members. Get 25 PRS in a cash. That's why I was talking about Prereus in this call. And yeah.

Robert Del Rey: We're doing all these things. Just to make sure everything is clear for you guys. Hopefully, we can get you excited about these and who knows maybe in the future one of us that are take over this campaign at least this campaign. I really would be very proud if that happens. These companies started last year Benjamin it's 100% community driven. As you can see, nobody from the core team is here. Sometimes they join, sometimes they not. But as you can see, this is 100% community driven. So hopefully all the things we're doing can inspire you and hopefully you can step up and get involved with the cash community. Even, it doesn't have to be silly as long as it comes from. A community, member all campaigns are welcome.

Robert Del Rey: you know how the process works. You have to take the discussion to github. You gotta get feedback and then you go and change. and after that, it's off to the races. This is the silly thread on Github here. You can find a wheelchair, the link. here you can find some updates. Each time we have a working group call. I come here And send the update about what we spoke about if there is documentation, I add documentations, for example, all the documents that I'm sharing with you, you can find them here. Again, this is 100% transparent, guys. if there is something you don't find and you want to know more about, feel free to ask a question, feel free to reach out. So we can sort it out together.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, again, that's all I have for today. Let's open up for the Q&A session. I don't know, you have something else. Benjamin, otherwise, feel free to drop your questions, guys. What's up? I see Oakley in the audience,…

oo o: Hi, hi everybody. Yeah, I thought the Zealy meetings had been moved to twice a month. I

Robert Del Rey: go ahead and

oo o: I just don't put that into this thing? And then I saw that there was a meeting going on, was that what time is taken, or is it going to be only twice a month for this limits?

Robert Del Rey: That's a good question or clearly, I know where this confusion is coming from. It was myself who actually suggested that to have a weekly call. However we decided to keep it weekly era. A lot of people are participating, wish we were grateful for that. There are many submissions that we're reviewing. So every week there is an update we want to give out So yeah, that's why we decided to keep it Basis and not by weekly. Hopefully that answers your question and go ahead and see I see your hand.

Benjamin B: Thanks, Robert. I just wanted to adhere that.

Robert Del Rey: Sure.

Benjamin B: Some of the meetings can be canceled, if we believe there is not enough to talk about or if we believe we can take everything just in the discord channel. Last week, we didn't have a meeting, but most of the time we have the weekly meetings now and if we don't, we will communicate in the description.


### 00:35:00

Robert Del Rey: Necessarily right, And the reason why we didn't have a meeting last week, it's because it was a holiday was Labor Day. So usually in those days the attendance is low. Anyways, so Benjamin and I decided to pull it off to call that to call the call of If that makes sense.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, I wanted to remind you guys this week. We have a few working group calls that you can join and earn extra points. We have the Seek, Shane, monthly meeting tomorrow. Also, the community monthly meeting tomorrow. So it's gonna be two for the price of one. And on Wednesday, we have the design. Especially interest group call. If you join those calls, we want you to join those calls so you can get involved with their cash community. And there is a secret word that we give away. And with that secret word, you can earn some extra 80 points.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, with the credit conversion rate fee, 15 XP points would be 1.5 AKP for joining the call. So yeah, I mean if it's a good price so guys getting both and for this week what we're gonna do yeah, we're gonna continue reviewing the missions for the sprint. Number two, I already saw that. We have 16 submissions waiting for us. So, that is where we're gonna work on this week. And like I said, a few times already, the missions to clean the rewards for the sprint. Number one. It's gonna go live as soon as this call ends I will send the announcement letting know and yeah that's gonna be it.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, that's all mice. Again, thank you so much everybody for joining. It's actually my pleasure giving you hosting this call and giving you updates about this campaign. But again, it wouldn't be great without without the people participating in this campaign. big enough to you guys for those listening every coordinator, that's all I have. Unless you have something else baby I believe we can wrap it up now. And wish everybody an excellent week ahead.

Robert Del Rey: All right. Three two, one. All right. thank you so much for doing it. Hope, your week is, it's great. And yeah. See you in their cash City group on discord or in the DMS. All right. Stay safe, guys.
