Robert Del Rey: All Happy Monday and happy labor day at least in Latin America. Thank you so much for joining to this cold life and those listening to the recording later. This is the cash silly working group. by weekly call So here we discuss all things silly.

Robert Del Rey: and yeah, what's next about really? So, let me jump right into it a sprint number two. Just end it last 27th of April. I haven't seen any of the results, but we have time to check that out. So Benjamin, I will go ahead and go over the leaderboard export the data and see what were the winners for Sprint number two. Yes, I will add now a sprint number two was a bit different than a sprint. Number one, I guess with the fewer missions and that's why you see fewer points than then then the first Sprint. That's okay. You live and learn as I say.

Robert Del Rey: And today's agenda. I would like to go over the missions. We are thinking about for a sprint number three the third and last month of this initial campaign. Let's see. after this campaign we continue with a few more months or if we just settle this down and move forward with something else. Let's see. The results are gonna speak on that. So let me share my screen real quickly.

Robert Del Rey: That's quite important people join these calls because you get access to early Alpha. And maybe we prepare for what's coming. So Let's go half a cash, Great. Let me know if you can see my screen Benjamin you.

Robert Del Rey: awesome Sold the offering we have for these upcoming Sprint It's a combination of New Missions. And existing missions rolling over to this Sprint.

Robert Del Rey: Dimensions of the top there was a little hype with them during I would say the last week. lo Texas speech Solution on a cache. This one came up for a question that I saw on a cash Discord and I wanted to turn it into a mission and it's very similar to Lama 3 on a cash Network. For those listening now, I'm sure and for those listening to the recording later, maybe you might know you might not know.

Robert Del Rey: Last week Lama 3 was deployed on a cash Network and CJ. One of the Akash insiders great guy props to him. He posted a small threat guy on how to deploy Lama Tree on a cache and I was impressed man that tweet got over 12,000 impressions. which is huge, so I'm trying to take not some Advantage but Try to use that.

Robert Del Rey: Try to use that reach and that impression and maybe try to bring some people to deploy Lama Tree on a cache. through silly They come to Seeley. They see the mission deploy Elementary on a cash. They do the mission and they will get reward for it. That's the main difference between the Seagate post and these ghosts people that did it using the CJ guide didn't get anything. So on a cash silly people will be able to get some prices to the employer TTS solution and deployment through on a cash Network, which is almost the same as kind of two for one mission in my opinion. let me see here some people join the call. Hey, Tyler welcome and happy Monday.

00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: Literally good man. No worries. Thanks for joining. We are just wrapping up the Sprint number two, and now going over the missions available for a spring number three just to give too long didn't read. So let me continue then this mission is cool. This is the attached document or this is the only content creation mission that we're gonna have during a sprint number three. and this one is about content this one is about creating a long 10 to 15 minute video. Talking about the history of cloud computing and what is the role of a cash Network in this market the cloud computing Market?

Robert Del Rey: There is only going to be one winner for this mission. Which I believe is going to help us getting the best content. Hopefully the winners submission.

Robert Del Rey: Hopefully know what I'm planning to do with the winner besides giving akt price. I also wanted to talk with Adam to see if the video is good enough. Maybe we can use that same video to add it to a cash EDU. Used to give a little context. I cash edu. It's like a beer tall platform. So people can get education about a cash and having a video about the history of cloud computing and a cash role in it. I think it's a pretty nice piece of information depends on the submitters. Let's see what the submitters come with. So moving on take it to GitHub. This mission is on paid. No rewards for this mission.

Robert Del Rey: Because I want people to learn what is the process of creating a discussion on a cash GitHub? how the mission look like Is that you have the link you have the best practices and the mission tells you you want to create a listing proposal. You want to Market in proposal you want a funding proposal you want an x y c proposal take it to GitHub. And in the mission, the people will see the steps to create a discussion that's gonna be an unpaid Mission, but hopefully we can Teach people coming to see how to open up discussions and get involved in their cash GitHub.

Robert Del Rey: And the last of the New Missions is the Akash bounties. This one has the question mark. Because I haven't done it yet. It's just like an idea. And it similar to take it to GitHub. It's gonna be on paid but it's gonna have an overview about the cash bounties and where people can find those bounties. I see it as a complement to the cash Bounty Hunter's channel on Discord. In the last one. Sorry, I jumped over this one. It's the newsletter subscriber. this one is a template that silly has in their page. And you just add the link. So people can subscribe and people just add the link and they subscribe to whatever newsletter you want them to subscribe. So I added the cash newsletter link to the mission.

Robert Del Rey: and people that want to get up to speed on a cash can subscribe from the newsletter and do this Mission? It's gonna be unpaid but it's still people gonna get XP points to do them missions. And yeah, those are the new offering we're gonna have on a Sprint number three before I go to the existing missions rolling over to a Sprint number three, are there any questions so far?

Robert Del Rey: All right. I see a thumbs down. I'm gonna take that as I know. Give me one second guys.

Robert Del Rey: All right. so existing missions rolling over to a Sprint number three These two are very popular in my opinion deploy persistent storage on a cash and provide compute on a cash. Yeah, we know a cash is trying to get of the best test hard work. So people bring those to a cash market place, but there are some people that don't have The Best of the Best Equipment, but still they want to get involved in a cash. They want to connect whatever resource they have just to get their feet on the water. so I think this missions

00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: help people get involved without having to think much about the hard work. They need to be a super serious and super profitable provider. so this gives the chance to people to interact on a cache with whatever Hardware they have get some XP points and Main I get paid we launched this mission on a Sprint number one the feedback we have Is that people didn't have much time to do this mission? So that's why we decided to roll it over to In a month number two, if I'm not mistaken, maybe Benji can help me a little bit in this area more people did the mission and actually get to spend a longer time.

Robert Del Rey: Providing on a cash and having a persistent storage on a cash. I messed up a quick second. Maybe when you want to add something about these two missions that be amazing just for the recording. If not, that's okay.

Benjamin B: Now I've been looking a little bit on this right now and we've had some providers trying to start. I'm not going to name many people here. But the last person I checked and where they have set up to provider. They haven't done it correctly. So they will not be approved in this Mission. I'm not sure if we've seen money and you providers here, but we've seen quite a few people and crying.

Robert Del Rey: Got it, Thank you so much. let's see. We have the third and last month. Hopefully more people jumped in. And the other two are on paid missions to it's during the cash insiders so far seven people have click on this link. I don't know if they did the application. I will need to ask Adam. And they invite three friends to a cash silly this one. It's unpaid it gives you XP points though, but doesn't pay you any akt and some people have done it too and not just decided. It doesn't hurt to leave these two open for the remaining of the campaign.

Robert Del Rey: I have here reminder for the steering monthly call all this I'm just practicing now, right because all this information I'm planning on sharing in the steering monthly call which is gonna happen these Thursday if I'm not mistaken. So the broader Community can know more about what we are doing in the cash, And some stats that I wanted to share with you here. It says the last three months. We had almost 300 members, which I find amazing. If you remove the people we got from the first pilot we did on November December. If you remove that people. you left us with 208.

Robert Del Rey: members so on month number three a month number two We were able to get 208 new members in a cash City. You can see the graphic here. This is the beginning of March when we started the first Sprint, that's where you can see this we went parabolic, right? And then you can see how we slowly are still increasing in community members. We shall find really cool one very big feedback that I gave Sealy. I was able to speak with them two three weeks ago. And is that this analytics is too poor in my opinion? I've been able to see other kinds of Analytics.

Robert Del Rey: and I feel somewhat limited with this. So that's something to keep in mind for future discussions the quality of the analytics that we get from Seeley. That's just a personal thought that I'm sharing right now. So yeah, this is the members amount and the top countries where most of the members are based. Which I find really cool. The last time we saw this we had five members from India But now you can see we have nine members from France ate from the Six from Indian Russia and many more this one maybe doesn't say much but I like to see that we are.

00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: How Global this is honestly, sometimes we are in the chat and you cannot believe everybody it's space either on Europe or in the US. and it's cool to see this information. That's why I added here. And some submissions I wanted to share with you and this is too close it out and then we can open up to comments or questions if you have any let me stop present in here. Wow, okay. let me

Robert Del Rey: I can wear life. Go ahead time.

Tyler Wright: my only question is it seems like the pilot was very successful. the first three or the first two sprints have been successful and there seems to be a fair amount of growth. I believe we're coming up correct me from wrong, but I believe that we might be coming up on the last or towards the end of this program. if that is in fact the case I would be of the thought process that this is something that should continue on. Have you all thought about Hosting another discussion or just going back to community pool for some more funding or what? That kind of looks like go ahead Benjamin.

Benjamin B: Thank We discussed this me in Robert's per for you joined them before we started recording. We don't have any details yet, but we can definitely start talking about this topic now and we have plans to Trying to ask the community pool to continue this program, but for the details. We have yet to discuss if you want to make an enlarger changes or anything. Maybe Robert has some ideas.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, just to add to that. We were discussing exactly that Tyler before you jumped in like Benji said and something we were discussing is that if we should open up a new thread on GitHub and add the information we have or if we should reopen the original Thread about this campaign that original thread it's close already. Honestly don't know if you can reopen close threats. So I'm honestly asking you.

Tyler Wright: Yes. Yes, you can I would say maybe make a new thread,…

Robert Del Rey: Okay.

Tyler Wright: somewhere away in the past overclock has done proposals for events, and every time it's a new quarter a new period they just make a new proposal. So I just think you can make a new proposal and reference the old proposal.

Robert Del Rey: Got it. okay. Thank you so much.

Tyler Wright: But at the highest level I and…

Robert Del Rey: All right.

Tyler Wright: many other people within the community that I've talked to and overclock Labs have been very happy with the leadership and with the progress of this program, so I would put one vote in representing Tyler to have you all continue this program.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you that's great to hear and your support your escort and everybody else has been Super Paramount. Honestly, honestly, Benji and I are super happy. We both learned a lot on this we learned about the work and we also learned about each other and yeah, I'm happy to hear that. You guys liked it and would support in case we want to continue. So amazing man amazing.

Robert Del Rey: Thank you for your endorsement menu. So the last thing I want to share is just one submission. This is an AI video that someone did. and uploaded to YouTube. It doesn't have many views But just wanted to share it. It's a few seconds long. Let me know if you can see it.

Benjamin B: I can see.

Robert Del Rey's Presentation: in the realm of digital Innovation the Future is already here.

Robert Del Rey: Can you hear to?

00:20:00

Robert Del Rey's Presentation: It's called the Akash Network.

Benjamin B: Yes.

Robert Del Rey's Presentation: Imagine a super cloud infrastructure. That's not just a service but a revolution it's about time. We started thinking bigger dreaming Bolder. Our world is becoming increasingly interconnected. And with that comes the need for more powerful decentralized Cloud Solutions. Enter a cash Network a game changer a disrupter. It's the world's first decentralized open source cloud, and it's here to redefine the future of cloud computing imagine. Having the power to run any application anywhere anytime. This is the promise of a cash Network get ready to unlock a world of possibilities where the sky is not the limit, but the starting point Welcome to a cash Network.

Tyler Wright: Damn, that seemed like a hype video.

Robert Del Rey: All right.

Tyler Wright: I got me excited.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, yeah, you do feeling me I saw this on Saturday and I was super happy about the video because It goes straight to the point. But at the same time it kind of promotes a cash Network. so yeah, just gonna take sure that with you that is one of the submissions we got in the Sprint number two. So yeah. Yeah, that's all I have for the agenda. We did an overview of the offering we're gonna have for the Communist Sprint number three. The screen number three is going to happen. It's going to start on Wednesday first and go all the way on to I believe it was Monday 27. I got to check that one out. But yeah, we shared the missions. We share some analytics and we also spoke about

Robert Del Rey: The future of this campaign with that being said, is there anything else you want to add to the conversation guys or any questions comment?

Robert Del Rey: Go ahead Benjamin.

Benjamin B: Yeah, I want to say that for the third month. Maybe we should consider having some larger missions we got. a big donation from Greg for their High School, which I'm guessing we're gonna send back to the community pool. unless we use it and we can really try to figure out some great missions we can use that money on because right now the first Sprint we spend approximately the calculator This print I think we spent a little less. and then this third month, I think we should try to overspend a little just because we got some extra funds within calculate for I think we're about 300 to 350 Katie for this Sprint, but I'm not quite sure yet. We haven't

Benjamin B: reviewed everything yet.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, okay. Let's check that out. And if you can…

Benjamin B: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: then just me that info so we can share it in the city in comedical. That is another metric that is good to share the equity paid in Rewards.

Benjamin B: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, thanks for bringing that nice catch 30 forgot about it.

Benjamin B: The Tyler is the other thing, please go ahead.

Tyler Wright: I have to run to another meeting but I can follow up with you all online again. I think this is moving and the right direction. let's have a sink if there is extra spend left over we can talk about either adding a discussion to say that hey can we extended we'll just keep these tokens and then we can go discussion after that, but I'll follow up with you offline. And there's other one thing I want to talk about is if we can include some Mission especially if it's a video because I really like the way that video is going back. We talked about super cloud. I do think that we need to

Tyler Wright: mention that more, from a branding perspective. I think it's something that folks that don't understand the caution is called compute Marketing in general and think you got this just have gpus it's a lot more than that. So if we can start to incorporate super cloud, I think that would go a long way. But just hit me up in the zealy channel. If you need me and we can continue to talk there between now and the next meeting but much appreciate you all and I'll follow up with some of you about other items and I'll see you all at steering committee. If not before but let me know if you need anything prior to steering committee, but I'll leave some time for you all as a part of the projects list to talk about zealy.

00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: Thank you so much that you sure Have a nice day, too.

Benjamin B: Thank you so much for joining.

Robert Del Rey: All…

Benjamin B: And with that,…

Robert Del Rey: All right.

Benjamin B: I think this meeting is concluded or do you have anything else?

Robert Del Rey: I don't have anything else to add bro. I'm just the Stoke about how things are going and it's great to hear when a third party like an outsider like Tyler say that things are going good from their perspective. So I think that says a lot about what we're doing All right.

Benjamin B: Yeah. Super happy to work on this.
