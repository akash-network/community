 ## Meeting Notes

### Sprint Overview  
- Sprint will start on October second and run until October thirtieth, lasting approximately five weeks  
- The main focus of the sprint will be Akash Console missions, including deploying a template and creating tutorial videos  
- Participants must first complete a mission to gain access to all Sprint missions  
- They need to submit an Akt address for reward purposes; this mission will unlock other tasks automatically  
- Some missions from previous sprints will continue, such as Akash Provider and Persistent Storage tasks, and the Design mission  

### Mission Review  
- A number of missions from previous sprints will remain available in this sprint unless participants have already completed them  
- Guidelines and expectations for missions have been updated to reduce ambiguity and ensure fairness  
- Missions that involve video submissions now have stricter quality standards to encourage better content  

### Video Submission Guidelines  
- Participants must create a step-by-step video tutorial that is between five to seven minutes long  
- Videos must include an introduction, a clear demonstration of deploying an application, and highlighting key features  
- AI-generated videos will be reviewed more carefully, and submissions will face stricter requirements  
- The prize for the best Akash Console video has been increased to Akt, but only three winners will be selected, rather than the higher number of smaller rewards given in the previous sprint  

### Submissions and Deadlines  
- A submission deadline will be implemented during the sprint to give the review team adequate time to process submissions  
- Any submissions after the deadline may not be reviewed, addressing the issue from Sprint where there were too many last-minute entries  
- Participants will still receive rewards for submissions after the deadline, but the review and reward process will be deferred to the next sprint  

### Reward Distribution and XP Calculations  
- Issues with XP points not being calculated or reflected properly on the leaderboard in Sprint were addressed  
- Manual review and adjustments are being made for the points and rewards that were missed in the previous sprint  
- A new system will hide some missions after deadlines to prevent accidental submissions after they close, ensuring clearer tracking of deadlines and rewards  

### Future Platform Considerations  
- The team discussed ongoing use of Zealy and the challenges that arose during Sprint  
- Galxe is being considered as an alternative platform, as it offers more robust features compared to Zealy  
- Galxe's structure may be better suited for managing rewards and missions, although no decision has been made yet  
- The transition from Zealy to Galxe, if chosen, will be communicated to participants well in advance  

### Questions and Discussion  
- Alex Pedersen raised a question about how tasks are assigned to specific sprints and how to track which tasks belong to which sprint  
- Robert Del Rey explained that Zealy does not allow users to view the history of sprint missions, but participants can see active and upcoming missions during the sprint period  
- Robert plans to provide feedback to Zealy on this limitation and explore ways to improve transparency for future sprints  
- A potential question for Galxe is whether it offers better visibility into mission history and sprint tasks  

### Upcoming Events and Action Items  
- A closeout report for Sprint is being prepared and will include details about mid-sprint issues such as the bot attack and missing XP points  
- Akash Console mission for Sprint will feature a feedback survey to gather insights from participants, which will be used to improve future missions  
- Participants were reminded of the upcoming Akash Website Working Group meeting on Thursday, which will feature a secret word for extra XP rewards  

### Action Items  
- Robert Del Rey will follow up with Zealy about improving mission tracking and provide feedback based on participant experiences  
- Robert and Benjamin B will finalize the setup for Sprint missions and ensure that all guidelines and deadlines are clear
- Robert Del Rey and Benjamin B to continue reviewing missions and preparing for Sprint #3 
- Benjamin B will ensure that all manual XP adjustments and reward payments from Sprint are completed before the release of the closeout report  
- Participants are encouraged to attend the Akash Website Working Group for a chance to earn bonus XP points
