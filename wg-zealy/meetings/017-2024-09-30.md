 ## Meeting Notes

### Sprint Overview  
- Sprint will start on October second and run until October thirtieth, lasting approximately five weeks  
- The main focus of the sprint will be Akash Console missions, including deploying a template and creating tutorial videos  
- Participants must first complete a mission to gain access to all Sprint missions  
- They need to submit an Akt address for reward purposes; this mission will unlock other tasks automatically  
- Some missions from previous sprints will continue, such as Akash Provider and Persistent Storage tasks, and the Design mission  

### Mission Review  
- A number of missions from previous sprints will remain available in this sprint unless participants have already completed them  
- Guidelines and expectations for missions have been updated to reduce ambiguity and ensure fairness  
- Missions that involve video submissions now have stricter quality standards to encourage better content  

### Video Submission Guidelines  
- Participants must create a step-by-step video tutorial that is between five to seven minutes long  
- Videos must include an introduction, a clear demonstration of deploying an application, and highlighting key features  
- AI-generated videos will be reviewed more carefully, and submissions will face stricter requirements  
- The prize for the best Akash Console video has been increased to Akt, but only three winners will be selected, rather than the higher number of smaller rewards given in the previous sprint  

### Submissions and Deadlines  
- A submission deadline will be implemented during the sprint to give the review team adequate time to process submissions  
- Any submissions after the deadline may not be reviewed, addressing the issue from Sprint where there were too many last-minute entries  
- Participants will still receive rewards for submissions after the deadline, but the review and reward process will be deferred to the next sprint  

### Reward Distribution and XP Calculations  
- Issues with XP points not being calculated or reflected properly on the leaderboard in Sprint were addressed  
- Manual review and adjustments are being made for the points and rewards that were missed in the previous sprint  
- A new system will hide some missions after deadlines to prevent accidental submissions after they close, ensuring clearer tracking of deadlines and rewards  

### Future Platform Considerations  
- The team discussed ongoing use of Zealy and the challenges that arose during Sprint  
- Galxe is being considered as an alternative platform, as it offers more robust features compared to Zealy  
- Galxe's structure may be better suited for managing rewards and missions, although no decision has been made yet  
- The transition from Zealy to Galxe, if chosen, will be communicated to participants well in advance  

### Questions and Discussion  
- Alex Pedersen raised a question about how tasks are assigned to specific sprints and how to track which tasks belong to which sprint  
- Robert Del Rey explained that Zealy does not allow users to view the history of sprint missions, but participants can see active and upcoming missions during the sprint period  
- Robert plans to provide feedback to Zealy on this limitation and explore ways to improve transparency for future sprints  
- A potential question for Galxe is whether it offers better visibility into mission history and sprint tasks  

### Upcoming Events and Action Items  
- A closeout report for Sprint is being prepared and will include details about mid-sprint issues such as the bot attack and missing XP points  
- Akash Console mission for Sprint will feature a feedback survey to gather insights from participants, which will be used to improve future missions  
- Participants were reminded of the upcoming Akash Website Working Group meeting on Thursday, which will feature a secret word for extra XP rewards  

### Action Items  
- Robert Del Rey will follow up with Zealy about improving mission tracking and provide feedback based on participant experiences  
- Robert and Benjamin B will finalize the setup for Sprint missions and ensure that all guidelines and deadlines are clear
- Robert Del Rey and Benjamin B to continue reviewing missions and preparing for Sprint #3 
- Benjamin B will ensure that all manual XP adjustments and reward payments from Sprint are completed before the release of the closeout report  
- Participants are encouraged to attend the Akash Website Working Group for a chance to earn bonus XP points  

# **Transcript**

Robert Del Rey: All Hello everybody. And welcome to today's Silly Working Group call, it's September, the 30th. I mean if it's the last day of the month, yeah.

Robert Del Rey: Two days agenda guys. We're gonna go over a sprint. Number two, We're gonna share some details about a Number three, some of things that happened with the missions, reviewing XP points rewards, pay out and more stuff. So, Hang in there.

Robert Del Rey: I will start with a sprint number three. spring number three, we're gonna start it on Wednesday, October the 2nd,

Robert Del Rey: It's gonna sound October the second and we're gonna go all the month on to October the 30th. So it's gonna be a five week sprint this time. Different from the previous screen. This one is going to have maybe one extra week For The missions are going to focus on a cash console each initially. There's gonna be a mission about deploying using one of the templates in a cache console. There is also another mission about doing About a Cash Console, It can be a tutorial video or it can be a video showcase in a particular feature that you believe is useful. But the main difference, you're going to notice in this missions for this sprint. Is that

Robert Del Rey: First, you need to get access to those missions. How you will get access. There is gonna be a mission to join the print. Number three in that mission. You need to add the Akt address. You want to use to get your rewards. So after you submit the address, the mission is going to autovalidate itself and then you're gonna have access to the Sprint 3 missions. How it work initially is that it was open. Do you join silly and did one of the missions? And then you had access to the sprint. in order to have access, you need to do this missions first. They join a spring three mission and then the other missions will become visible to you.

Robert Del Rey: Besides the Cash console missions. We're going to keep some missions from previous sprints. Those are the cash provider missions and deploy. Persistent storage mission. and also, the design mission. We got some cool submissions there. and we thought that it will be fun to keep it for this sprint. If you did the mission in the sprint, number two, sorry if you did the mission in the screen, number two, you won't be able to do it in the script number three. But if you didn't do it in the sprint, number two they will finish that you will be able to do it in the spring tree. So, I will stop there from one quick. Second in case you have a question about the print. Number three,

Robert Del Rey: that's totally fine. Remember that the groups are open to share your questions. I'm actually impressed for the activity. We had in this last week I guess Benjamin and I were not expecting the amount of questions and the amount of submissions we are still reviewing submissions, But yeah, even on telegram, we have some questions on Twitter. We're getting questions of Seeley. So it seems that we're getting bigger. We're getting noticed, we're gonna keep pushing to keep attracting people to a cash ceiling in the cash community. So yeah, that's all I have for sprinting. Number three, yeah. I was gonna say the second biggest different, you're gonna see in this missions in the spring tree. It's a improve guidelines and rules. And guides.

Robert Del Rey: Just for the sake to not leave enough space for ambiguity, To make sure things are as clear as possible and everything is as fair as it can. We are more clear about the things we are expecting of the missions.


### 00:05:00

Robert Del Rey: let me for example, open one or On the Akash Council. For example. On the Akash Console, Since you only need to go to console, get one of the templates and run a deployment, you won't have many requirements. The only big requirements is that the deployment most Be deployed in a cash main net instead of testnet. But for example, the mission to do the video, you're going to find more requirements because something we had in the spring. Number two with the videos people were just going to

Robert Del Rey: to video IO Office AI and those video editing AI tools and they just submitted an AI video. And yeah, I would say so for this spring three, we're gonna be taking videos submissions again. But again the requirements are going to be a bit more tough because again, we want to get of the best submissions, we reduce the price. Sorry.

Robert Del Rey: It's backwards. We actually increased the price for their cash console video.

Robert Del Rey: Let me tell you how much the price is gonna be for this One second. Yeah, so the price for this video is gonna be 50 Akt. You heard For that video you can get 50 Akt, 5 0.

Robert Del Rey: Which it's a big amount, But again, we want to get the best submissions. The flip side is that. Instead of having 20 winners, like we did on the previous sprint with little Akt prices. Now, we're gonna have a higher price, but it's gonna be only three winners will be able to get these 50 Akt price. So, yeah, you're gonna find out that the guidelines is gonna tell you exactly what we're expecting for you like, having an intro demonstrate the process of deploying the application highlight, the key features that you like, and other requirements, The video has to be between five and seven minutes. It has to be a step by step guide. The quality, the graphics, etc, etc.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, this one gets me really excited and wait to see the submissions. Again, on the screen. Number two, we got

Robert Del Rey: A decent number of submissions. And we had a handful of really, really good submissions that I sent out we add them in the content, submissions document that we have and we plan on rewarding. Those going, the extra mile by the end of the campaign, which ends at the end of this sprint. The screen number three. So yeah. That's that with a new missions and some expectations that we have. Again this is totally open for feedback suggestions. We got some really good comments and the springs number two hopefully we get best more feedback to improve this on the sprint. Number three One thing that is going to be new.

Robert Del Rey: On their cash console mission. Let me show you. I will share my screen right now. Once.

Robert Del Rey: But you.

Robert Del Rey: One second. I mean if here you can see some of the missions that we have. summations that we don't have open submissions that maybe we won't open never but yeah, these missions are in draft, but the one that I wanted to show you was in console

Robert Del Rey: For example, here. You need to submit a mainland link lead into your deployment, or a public link to a video showing you you're deployment. So you have to waste two ways of submit this. You can either are at the link to your deployment do a video showing us your deployment either way, it's gonna work fine. But the other difference here and hopefully this can help the Akash team Getting valuable feedback. Is that here you have a survey let's say or a scale so you can rate your experience using Console hopefully, we can get some five start but hopefully we get older reviews and hopefully that information can help the cash team. Getting some insights about how people feel about a cash console.


### 00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: so yeah, that's something new. we added in this mission. So you will be able to submit your link and then you can rate how much you like your experience using Console. Yeah, that's something new. Benji, my man, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but if you want to talk about what happened with the XP points and the manual calculations for the rewards, now will be a good time for that.

Benjamin B: Sure, thank you, Robert. So we go to report lost month of basically Completed a mission and they noticed that they weren't in the leaderboard or in the pale statement for that sprint. so we eventually found that if we reviewed something after this printed, it didn't go into sprint, the sprint, stocks to me, mission was Submitted to let me dealing the code to the current sprint either. so basically, This is why we have to do the changes to the sprints. We're going to keep the sprints and working 24/7. And always being available. But for some of the missions, we will have that lines and we will hide them after the deadline. So you can't accidentally and find it all through the line.

Benjamin B: All of the missing rewards from the previous sprint. And this sprint also will be manually added to everyone's rewards and we will pay them out. We did release a list for all the rewards found missing from the previous sprints. if we published in the description, For the ones. And being missed between this one. And the next we won't release a list for that. We will just include it In the rewards lists as normal. But if you do find anything, that is missed. Yes, please reach out and we can take a closer look.

Benjamin B: Back to you Robert unless you think I missed something or if there's any questions.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks so much money. No. Actually, the only thing that I can add is the Things evolve day by day. We learn new things day by day. Seeley, is a tool that has three four years around. I've been using silly for two years I believe. And yeah, we're still learning how it actually works. so, yeah, hopefully this don't happen again and that's the reason why we are gonna have that lines for the submissions. So basically, the strength number three, it's gonna go from the second onto the 30th. But you will have, let's say use an example.

Robert Del Rey: Until the 24th of the 25 one week prior to do your submission, that way the last week of the sprint, we can actually take enough time to review all the missions and those people submitting after the deadline, those submissions won't get reviewed. And I guess that will help us not repeating what happened on the sprint. Number two, we had lots of submissions and even though we were reviewing the submissions just kept coming in and kept coming in. So that is one thing with it. I'll go ahead. Thank you.

Benjamin B: I just wanted to add hair that if you, Submit to a mission that is available all of the time. we're going to release one of the old missions where you have to create your Own docker image from scratch. And yet to depart on a course, it was a free step mission. if you do one of those missions and you submit it later than the submission deadline, You will get to rewards, but it might not be rewarded to you until the next sprint, because we can't guarantee that if you submit it on the last day or last hour that will review it. So, that is why we have The deadline. Sometimes we might review everything. Anyways. But just because of that, we want to reserve the right. So


### 00:15:00

Benjamin B: if you submit it late enough, you will get it later. other than that, it shouldn't be something that the user has to think about if there's a mission And the deadline is more strict. We will have it in the description and we will hide it as well so that you want to find it by mistake.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks so much baby. Also, Another thing that directly wanted to say is that maybe today we're using silly. But maybe tomorrow.

Robert Del Rey: I don't know. Somebody else, introduces us to another platform that helped us do a better job. Than silly. And we will definitely consider that galaxies and other contender and we are after Adam came back. He quickly mentioned that, maybe we could try and see How this would work if we were to move it to Galaxy, because that could be a possibility. One thing that I have noticed between the two platform is that Galaxy is a little more robust in the sense of the structure that they have silly, it's more basic. You can do, lots of stuff Sealy on a basic level. But with most of the things like rewards and payments are very automatic. so,

Robert Del Rey: So yeah, that could be one of the reasons we could consider Galaxy in the future. We are still in the Phase of course we will. Definitely keep you posted on any changes we do in a cache ceiling or a cash galaxy who Yeah, thank you so much Benjamini for that. And The last topic I had in the agenda is about the sprint. Number two ending. The spring and the last Friday the 27th.

Robert Del Rey: I started doing the sprint For those of you that don't know, the Closed Out report is some monthly report that we do. And in that report, we share all that happen in silly during that month when a sprint. Number one ended with release one. If you want to have a look, you can find it on discord or you can go to Silly Github on a cache and you can find it there for the sprint. Number two, we're gonna do the same. We're already started, and it's gonna be released this week so you can find deeper details about what happened in the campaign things that will be included there. For sure are the bot attack that we had during mid month.

Robert Del Rey: in what happened with the XP points, not being automatically added to the leaderboard. I accept question in the chat Alex's work and I see what task correspond to each sprint. I'm a bit confused with Sealy. Yes, Alex, that's a great question and yeah, honestly we share some of that confusion. it can get confusing My best to answer that. At least. From my perspective as an admin. I can go to a cache ceiling. I can click on the leaderboard.

Robert Del Rey: let me share my screen. Yeah, a picture is for a thousand words, that's what they say, So let me just share this real quick. All righty. So here you can see the top leaderboard. This is all During all time of this campaign, we have 2,640 participants. these are the top people, And here, you can see the past experience that we had in the past. This is the spring the season. Number two, And here, particip you see the points are lower. because this one, Divides. All the participants per sprint. So yeah, here you can see each participants for Sprint but this doesn't answer your question, man.

Robert Del Rey: Here, I cannot see the missions. We had available. Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: Let me go here in the course dashboard here. You can see the quest that we have For example. This one. Join the sprint. Number three.


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: This is the mission you have to do in order to have access to other missions. So here, you can see it says a string, right? You can see the screen, right?

Robert Del Rey: I would need to add. This mission here where he said I Add that mission to a sprint. Number three. And that mission will appear. but, I don't have a way to tell you During a sprint number through these were the missions that we had available because I don't have a to see I don't have a way to see that. Honestly, we can add any mission what that we want to any strength. We can add this to two, number three, number one, but I cannot see the history. this mission has been in Number two, in the past. There's no way for me to see that. so Benjamin if you want to add to that but yeah, feel free to

Benjamin B: yeah, if you go to a quests, you can preview it, that's how the user would see it, and this is the user view and everything you see on the user, view will be on the sprint. So if you see anything here during Windows print is active, that means the mission is available for that sprint. And us, Robert said for previous prints, we don't really have that information. And we only have the information for the current sprint for the user. and we're in between screen, so the information to be as accurate right now, but if you were to be a user and you see this, welcome to koshy, admission would be available, If you go down to build on a course and see emissions there, those are available. sometimes, if you click on them, we will have something saying,

Benjamin B: That line and the update. If you work on a mission and you think it will take you longer than that's deadline. You should probably not do it because We want accept the Submissions for that mission for super long, but unless there is a deadline. To think about everything you see there can be worked on.

Robert Del Rey: The mistletoology a bit more there benjamining. Since we don't have a sprint active right now, you will be able to see all the missions. We have life at the moment. Anybody can join a cash Seeley and do these missions and they will count to the all-time XP. But they will not count towards a sprint. So let's do a life example right now.

Robert Del Rey: Let's create the sprint. number three right now, life You can see it here. what was the name that I have that? We copy and paste real quick. Your life. Okay. So, let's do. Silly season. Number two, this is a spring Salient Number three. Here, you can set up the duration of the sprint, like, we were saying. The spring is gonna go from October 2nd.

Robert Del Rey: until the 30th attack. From AAM to 8 AM. That's totally fine. And here, this is what I was saying, Alex. So here included Quest.

Robert Del Rey: I can click here and select which quest we want to appear in the sprint. Number three, I can either select them all which I'm not gonna do. Or just manually search for them. That one. Where is it? Join a spring tree. Wow, we have done. Lots of missions. join a spring tree. And welcome to seal. I'm going to add those in the sprint. Number three. Other missions, we need to add a cash console, you have the Cash video. And providers. We got the cash provider.


### 00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: And persistent a storage. We said the design mission was gonna be available, right? We have design here. And all the sick and working group calls are going to be available to. So, here are the six and he are the working group calls.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah. Yeah, those will be the mission available.

Robert Del Rey: I click on Save, you can see it's a sprint starts in one day.

Robert Del Rey: but even here, I don't have a way to show you these are the missions that will be available when the sprint starts though. Here you will be able to let me go to This is the user view. Here you can see this missions because we don't have a sprint open, but when the spring tree starts automatically, these will be removed. And the new missions will be available. We'll be visible. The missions that I just added Now life, they're doing a screen three, the working group missions. Those missions will appear when the sprint 3, it's active. But going back to your question It seems that there is no way to kind of see the offering We append.

Robert Del Rey: Ing spring? That could be a good feedback for Sealy. I will take care of that and see if I get an answer and also, that could be a good question for Galaxy again. Great question, I briefly. So a hand feel free to step in and Take the mic. If not, I will take one quick second to do a brief note and then continue.

Benjamin B: I'll just have been here quickly. I saw a question from Victor earlier in the shop and I already answered it. So I think that's why he took his handle. Alex, did you have anything or It looks like you're on the muted, but we don't hear anything.

Benjamin B: Maybe you're muted in some other way. Or don't have the right permissions in the browser or something.

Benjamin B: All right, the mic is not connected. I see then back to Robert.

Robert Del Rey: All Thanks, I forgot to add the image also of the working group. But with all tasks we reviewed. Old tests will be reviewed. I mean, for the I don't know What happens with me with the through and three but for the sprint. Number two. Yes, we have to review those missions pending and we will manually. Add the XP and sequently pay the rewards. So don't worry about that. We got a cover. What we were saying is that for a sprint, number three, we're gonna have a submission deadline and that way. We won't have mission spending for review after the sprint is over. We will make sure all nations are reviewed before the sprint is over. Yeah. that.

Robert Del Rey: And with that, Already been here for half an hour. Thank you everybody again for doing and those listening to the recording later. I already exhausted my agenda. we went over the sprint. Number three details, the details about the new missions, the rewards distribution and the manual calculations. And the sprint. Number two, closeout report. We also handle some questions for you. Keep them coming. In case you have more questions. The silly Channel in a cash discord. It's open for you.

Robert Del Rey: so yeah, with that being said, I don't have anything more to speak about, actually being deny will continue working together, reviewing this missions and getting everything ready for you for the sprints number three. So yeah, it's gonna be a bc morning for us on this side of the world. So, without being said, guys,

Robert Del Rey: any questions concerned regrets? I want to share now?


### 00:30:00

Robert Del Rey: if not that story, fine, just a quickly reminder that on Thursday, we have the Cash website working group, And remember, there is a silly mission of the Cash website, working group. So there is a secret word that I will say, in that call. And with that secret word, you can claim extra XP points for you. so yeah, that's the only reminder I had And yeah, that's all for me. Thank you again for your time attention and see you in the Metaverse. All right.

Robert Del Rey: Stay safe, everybody.
