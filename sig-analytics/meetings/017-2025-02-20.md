## Meeting Notes

### Review of ongoing analytics-related projects within the Akash ecosystem
- Tyler Wright opened the meeting by welcoming participants and outlining the purpose of the SIG Analytics group, which is to promote and discuss analytics efforts on Akash.
- Tyler highlighted the historical success of the group, including the open-sourcing of the Akash indexer originally delivered by Cloudmos.
- Tyler noted that the indexer continues to evolve with contributions from Max and others, and is widely used by teams building solutions on Akash.

### Update on Chakra team’s progress and community pool funding utilization
- Tyler provided an update on the Chakra team’s [efforts](https://akash.chakra.dev/), noting:
  - The team received funding from the community pool.
  - They have consistently delivered on their milestones and have been responsive to feedback from the community.
  - Their focus is on making Akash indexer data more accessible, particularly for potential investors and GPU-related analytics.
  - Tyler shared a link to Chakra’s work and encouraged participants to engage directly with Oxnirmal (Chakra’s founder) via GitHub for any specific questions or feedback.

### Discussion of Mintscan’s proposed shift to a paid service and implications for Akash
- Tyler informed the group about Cosmostation’s new business model:
  - Mintscan, which was previously a free tool used by the community, will now require $10,000 per month for continued support and maintenance for Akash.
  - This amounts to $120,000 per year.
  - Tyler explained that Cosmostation representatives were present at Akash Accelerate and communicated their intent to support Akash but noted the need to cover business costs.
  - The community will need to consider whether to fund Mintscan or explore alternative solutions.

### Presentation of alternative block explorer and monitoring tools (Zone Scan and bots) by Dan Pavel Sinkovicz
- Dan Pavel Sinkovicz presented Zone Scan as an alternative block explorer:
  - The tool provides standard block explorer features including validator data, transactions, governance proposals, and block details.
  - Zone Scan offers enhanced validator analytics such as historical uptime, voting power, commission rates, and a color-coded calendar view for quick visual assessment.
  - Features include endpoint monitoring with response time and uptime data, plus detailed insights into validator signatures on individual blocks.
  - A live chain view feature displays validator votes and block data in real time.
  - Zone Scan includes tools useful during software upgrades for tracking upgrade status across validators.
  - The account view shows asset distribution, balance details, staking, vesting schedules, and allows calculations for vesting token distributions.
  - The tool allows comprehensive search capabilities including cross-chain validator search, transaction hashes, blockchains, and accounts.
- Dan also demonstrated [Discord and Telegram bots](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/957):
  - These bots provide real-time alerts and monitoring for validator status, proposals, upgrades, and endpoints.
  - They include customizable alert thresholds for validator downtime.
  - Commands are designed for ease of use with options like viewing subscriptions, uptime settings, and browsing blockchains.
- Tyler and Dan encouraged feedback from the community on the demo and highlighted the potential for a future proposal to fund continued development.

### Community feedback and next steps on analytics dashboards and tools (including proposals from Blockworks and Zone Scan)
- Tyler shared information on a proposal from [Blockworks](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/957):
  - The proposal aims to build dedicated analytics dashboards for Akash, targeting researchers and investors globally.
  - Blockworks brings experience from working with other blockchain networks and is seeking feedback on their proposed metrics and budget.
- Tyler emphasized the importance of community engagement:
  - Asked attendees and broader community members to provide feedback on Zone Scan, the monitoring bots, and the Blockworks dashboard proposal.
  - Highlighted that Dan may submit a governance proposal for funding Zone Scan and the bots, contingent on community feedback.
  - Encouraged active participation in ongoing discussions on Discord and in governance forums to shape next steps.
- Tyler concluded by noting that these topics will be raised again in the steering committee meeting and other community channels to maintain momentum.

## Action Items
- Tyler to share the meeting recording and notes with the community to facilitate engagement and feedback.
- Community members to review and provide feedback on:
  - The Zone Scan tool and monitoring bots.
  - The Blockworks dashboard proposal and proposed metrics.
  - The Chakra analytics tool via GitHub.
- Dan to monitor community feedback and prepare formal governance proposals for Zone Scan and bot funding based on input received.
- Tyler to raise these discussions during the upcoming steering committee meeting and encourage further community involvement.

## **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All Welcome everybody to the AOA special interest group for analytics. SIG Analytics meets on a quarterly basis to discuss all things related to analytics on Akos. there's a number of again things that have been discussed historically. this group came together and helped to make sure that the indexer brought to us by cloudmos at the time now again Max is part of the core team but that is something that came out of this working group excuse me the special interest group where that was open source and there was a number of atoms I added to that indexer since then there's been a number of teams that

Tyler Wright: look to develop solutions that leverage the data in the indexer and make it more accessible to various groups. One team that has been actively working on those efforts is the chalker team.  They got money from the community pool and have been very responsive on the work that they've been doing leveraging again indexer data to make it more accessible for potential investors people that are learn learning more about Akos again their focus is on GPUs but you can see that they have a working product and are continuing to take feedback from the community after again getting community pool funds for their efforts.

Tyler Wright: So here's a link to the work that they've been doing. again if anybody has any questions from the chakra team Oxnormal who I think is their founder is very responsive in this open issue. I think some more work is continuing to be done around some of the queries and asks from some folks that are leveraging the chakra tool. but again please feel free to reach out to Nurmal in GitHub if you have any specific questions that you need answering. Anyone have anything that they want to talk about in terms of the community pool effort from Chakra and the work that they've been doing? again it's been consistent.

Tyler Wright: they followed up and they've been in my opinion a good steward of the funds they got from the community pool. All right. there are a couple of other agenda items that I wanted to make sure were discussed and brought up on the record. I think it's been previously discussed in some settings and we might have some more conversations about this during sig chain but one of the groups that provides a lot of blockets data to akash is a team cosmo station that does a lot of work including again building mintcan right

Tyler Wright: their business model has changed where previously that was a tool that was free to use for the community. I think something that the community used a great deal. I think now there is a desire to sell that tool to different protocols. and so as recently as last week at Akos Accelerate members of Cosmo station were there in person and on behalf of the Akos community I talked to a member of the cosmos team really their goal again they really like working with Akos and really believe in all that Akos is doing but again have bills that they need to pay in

Tyler Wright: business that they're trying to continue to build. And their expectation is really for $10,000 per month over the course of a year. So $120,000 a year for continued management of Minscan for the Akash network.  I know that there are other block explorers out there that don't cost the community anything. they I believe are intending to put forth a discussion and a proposal but have not done so yet.

Tyler Wright: but again this is something that I've already let the community know in a number of different avenues because again as a member of Overclock Labs team part of my role is really to be a shepherd information for the sake of the community. so I've relay that information. I know that there are other folks in the community.  I think but one of them is here today Dan who is a great validator both on the AOS chain and elsewhere and has developed a number of solutions including a block explorer that would not cost nearly as much. so I know that Dan may want to talk about that a little bit today.


### 00:05:00

Tyler Wright: but again I just want to make the community aware that again there should be a discussion happening and there might be some further conversations get that is had in SIG chain about the future of Minscan. I know it's something that the core team uses in reference to a number of different governance proposals etc. but again times are changing and their business is continuing to grow and we respect that and understand that but just want to see what the community is interested in terms of next steps there.

Tyler Wright: again I do there is a discussion that is analytics related and again just want to have a preliminary dis bring it to people's attention right now. there are a couple of folks that are looking to build additional dashboards. one is LinkedIn discussions right here. from a team at Blockworks. so I would love for people to give feedback to that discussion. I'll share it on the screen right here.

Tyler Wright: But another discussion that was put forth recently is from somebody that's here on the call Dan who's been working on some dashboards and additional resources, materials and bots that can go inside discord discord that provide very useful information about the chain to members of the Akash community. so I'm going to link to those specific discussions and then Dan wanted to see if you wanted to talk briefly with the community about some of these Discord monitoring systems specifically around IBC the chain and some of the endpoints.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: Yeah, hey my name is Dan. as Tyler said, we are validating, we are mainly a validator, but now we are trying to pivot to building things. So, we observed that means scan is going to change their business model. So, we thought we can build an alternative to Minscan. So, that's what we're doing right now. it's called zone scan currently. can I share my screen? Is that relevant right now or not really?

Tyler Wright: No, please feel free.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: Yeah. Right.

Tyler Wright: Feel free.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: Just a second. So, you should be able to see my screen. So, I'm going to run through the block explorer really fast. I don't want to eat too much time here. but it's basically everything you need from a basic explorer like overview data, validator data. But we also have some cool other features like analytics for each validator. So if you click on a certain validator, you will have the analytics tab here and you will be able to see past uptime.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: So historical up time max is 90 days and then you can see also voting power going past 90 days. commission same and then I think this is the best view which is a calendar and it shows each day and D time for each day. So let me find another one maybe that has a bit more blocks missed or something. but yeah you get the point it will turn yellow red whatever as per the legend says here. so then we have the same thing but for endpoints where we track response time up time and then we also have the same as with validators but it's for response time and up time.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: So, it's healthy or unhealthy. So, I'm going just through the more unique features right now because I don't want to take too much time, but it has everything norm does. we made a bit more progress or more emphasis into showing more details about governance proposals. for instance here can see a bunch of things. You can expand the object to see more details and so on. we also have basically just taken means scan feature with the tree map where it shows the violators their votes and such in the charts and here we can see by vote type you can filter them.


### 00:10:00

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: same with blocks. We try to display as much information as possible and try to make them look a bit, easier to dig at the click of a button, you can switch between hex and B 64. encoding formats. here you can see transactions. And this a bit more unique. You can see each validator's signature for this block.  And same with transactions. We try to show as much information as possible. and you can expand them and so You can expand the objects inside same for events utilities. So this is pretty cool. This is basically a live view of the chain.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: It's basically cool data, pulls the latest block, shows the validator votes. if the validator committed or didn't commit or it has different hash, you can stop it so it doesn't continue playing. You can go back to different block. You can put a custom block in here.  And in consensus mode, this is helpful during software upgrades. So we can come here and see who's left to upgrade who are we waiting for upgrades, this is pretty much what you would expect just showing the proposals for the software upgrades.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: and for monitoring we have a lots of bots for telegram bots for upgrades for endpoints proposals and validators downtime and such. So this is pretty much we also have the feature where you can search for bunch of stuff crosschain validators by monikers by operator addresses. You can search for transaction hashes.  You can search for blockchains for accounts and so one last thing is account page basically which is So we display it here the account of the validator itself. but I'm going to just search for it here.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: So you can see how it looks. So you got a summary with asset distribution available token balances and so on. You got transactions staking so active and abounding delegations. also has for vesting accounts and here you can calculate how much tokens this wasting account is going to receive over a period of time and the details of the account. So that's pretty much it I think. Yes. I'm going to go through the bots just really really quick so you can see how they work.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: They have this straightforward commands. you can click browse blockchains to see available blockchains. you can go to my status to see all the status of your subscriptions basically your validators and such. And then you go to uptime settings. So you have three thresholds to receive notifications for when the validator goes down. that's pretty much how they all work all the bots. and yeah, that's pretty much it. yeah, let me know your thoughts or…

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: anything really. Thank you.

Tyler Wright: Thank you very much again.

Tyler Wright: Dan has put forth a proposal that I will share in the chat for again these Akash discord monitoring systems. I don't think there's a proposal quite yet for some of the zone scan efforts. but I think you wanted to showcase that to the community, get some feedback. again, there might be a world because there's a number of features that Minscan has. obviously Dan has built upon those features and has added a number of new additional features that I think are very beneficial during network upgrades. I know some other folks in the community have built kind of similar tools but not allinone.


### 00:15:00

Tyler Wright: so again, please feel free to raise your hand right now give feedback to Dan for these couple of proposals because as Dan mentioned, again, they're a great validator in the community, but they want to continue to look to add value. and so they're looking to connect with the community and see if there's value add from some of these items and then they'll look to push forward.  So, please make your voices heard, ask Does anyone have any questions about anything that Dan has showcased here today or demoed here today related to zone scan or any of the specific bots for IBC monitoring or endpoints? Cool.

Tyler Wright: again, if there's no additional questions, I think that somebody left a question in the discussion already. I'm going to make sure that other people leave u comments whether it's negative or questions in the chat as well. Just I know this is a very again opinionated community.  One thing for speaking on behalf of Overclock Labs, I know during network upgrades, there's a great deal of value in understanding and having a source of truth for who's left to upgrade who hasn't upgraded yet who's on which version. I know that we have some again small tools that we use internally but having a source of truth that all the validators can use would be of great value especially during network upgrades.

Tyler Wright: So, this is something that I think has a great deal of value, but again, I just want to hear from, the general community. again, Dan dropped a link in, the test environment for zone scans in the chat, but just want to make sure that people make their voices heard, so that Dan can take next steps in terms of feedback from the community. Thank you very much, Dan. Cool.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: Yeah, thank you very much for letting me showcase zone scan here.

Tyler Wright: Again, one other additional dashboard that I want to make sure that people get feedback from.

Tyler Wright: I don't think anybody's here from the team. but speaking on behalf of the team, there's a group out there that's looking to build more public dashboards based upon in the indexer and some of the work that Chakra has been doing. again, their goal is over the next 12 or 20 more months to have a partnership with a network to build kind of dedicated analytics dashboards.  I think the audience for these dashboards is research for again investors all over the world. Blockworks seems to have a great reputation in that space. so again please look through this proposal. You can see some of the other chains that they work very closely with prior examples.

Tyler Wright: understand the budget the things that they are trying to capture and the metrics they're going to build in this dashboard. If there's any metrics that you think are not there that should be there please feel free to drop in comments but I would love for people to get involved in so this is again a discussion from block works.  I've already dropped in discussion that Dan had put forth for the dashboards, but again I know this analytics group doesn't meet that often, but there are a couple of teams that have either push forth discussions, have already started work like Dan and have demos that they can show or are thinking about playing discussions as it pertains to analytics and kind of data management around the Akash network.

Tyler Wright: So, again, I just want to bring these things forth to the community. I'll probably reference them again during the steering committee tomorrow, but just want to make sure that people get involved in these discussions, ask questions, get feedback, etc. And I know a lot of people couldn't make this call today, but probably listen to the recording.  And again, I'll bring this up in a number of other conversations and make sure that the recording and notes are made available quickly so that people can start to get feedback and see some of the work from Dan and hear some of the other commentary. Anyone have any questions about either of the proposals?


### 00:20:00

Tyler Wright: anything Dan brought up the proposal discussion from the Blockworks team or anything else analytics related that they want to discuss or make sure that we bring up right now. All right. If not then we'll just keep the conversations in discussions again.  I'm going to make sure over the next couple of days people give as much feedback as possible. I believe Dan would like to put a proposal on chain sometime soon so I can continue work on building out some of these bots as well as I believe it'll probably be a discussion happening soon and potentially a proposal shortly after if the community is okay with it for zone scan efforts so we can continue development there.

Tyler Wright: so I urge people to start to leave comments, ask questions, give votes of positivity, whatever, as quickly as possible so that these teams can continue to move forward. All right, if there's nothing else, then again, we can end this call. But again, I'll make sure that the notes, shout out to George who helps out with the notes from the community.  I'll make sure the notes and recording are made available quickly. I'll talk about this in some other calls. Make sure this is brought up in steering committee tomorrow. just so that we can continue to get momentum around some of these ideas and some of the stuff that's already being built. Major thanks again to Dan for joining here today and sharing some of the work that he already done.

Tyler Wright: please please get involved in the discussion around the discord monitoring bots and then look out for a proposal soon and get feedback in Discord or in the proposal when it's available around the zone scan block for solution. All right I hope everyone has a great day. Thank you to all that are listening later. but yeah, follow up with you soon and thanks again. Have a great day, y'all.

Dan Pavel Sinkovicz: Have a great day.
