- Tyler explained the historical need for an open-source indexer, acknowledging the Cloudmos team's contributions and their recent decision to open source their work.
- Tyler emphasized the community's focus on building and expanding upon the indexer provided by the Cloudmos team.
- Tyler mentioned that some community members have been discussing the activation of an archive node for various use cases.
### Update on Cloudmos Team's Indexer Work
- Maxime Cyr confirmed that the indexer has already been switched over and is open source.
- Maxime Cyr shared a [link for accessing](https://github.com/akash-network/cloudmos/tree/main/indexer) the code and encouraged everyone to explore it.
- Max B discussed changes made to the indexer, focusing on GPU and USDC tracking.
- Max B mentioned the release of a new dashboard version that displays USDC and AKT spending separately and the total value spent over time.
- Max B noted the indexing of the sandbox for testing new features.
- Max B discussed plans for adding more information related to GPUs, including GPU counts and statistics on models offered and used.
   - #### Database Access Discussion
   - Jin mentioned working on queries to answer questions based on the Cloudmos database.
   - Jin inquired about the possibility of connecting to the Cloudmos database.
   - Jin Lim requested updating the database image on GitHub to reflect the changes in GPU stats.
   - Maxime Cyr agreed to create a new snapshot for users to manually insert the necessary columns.
 ### PRD and Analytics Dashboard Discussion
 - Davut Dayan introduced himself, expressing interest in the discussion and sharing his role as the co-founder of [Data Lenses](https://www.datalenses.zone/chain/osmosis), an interactive analytics platform.
 - Davut inquired if there were any undisclosed insights from the PRD that could be useful and offered potential support through his platform.
 - Tyler suggested that the PRD reflects the most current thought process discussed during analytics monthly meetings.
 - Davut expressed his plans to explore and visualize the data with data lenses and possibly provide updates in future meetings.
 - Max shared the link to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akash-network/cloudmos/), guiding Davut to the sections where he could find the code for front-end visualization.
### Other Matters Discussed
- Davut discussed their vision for Data Lenses to become a sophisticated tool in the ecosystem.
- He shared plans to expand the platform to cover multiple app chains in the Cosmos ecosystem and potentially introduce revenue models in the long term.
- Tyler inquired if there was a fee associated with using Data Lenses, and Davut explained that grants initially covered costs, but their goal is to provide the service to the community for free.
## Action Items
- Jin Lim to explore the GitHub repository for the code used in the indexer and possibly contribute to front-end visualization.
- Max to create a new snapshot of the database image to reflect changes in GPU stats.
- Maxime Cyr to ensure the availability of the new snapshot for those wanting to update the database image themselves.
- Group to be available to assist Davut with any questions or support related to the analytics and front-end development.
- Davut to explore the Cloudmos GitHub repository and provide updates in the next meeting.
