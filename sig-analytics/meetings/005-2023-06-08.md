## Notes

Tyler:
- Zack working on indexer, added [discussion to Github](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/234)

Zack:
- initially built indexer for Secret Network analytics in 2020, components needed fixes after every upgrade
- refactored indexer from the ground up a few months ago to be more robust for upgrades (open-source build)

Boz:
- would all [PRD asks](https://github.com/akash-network/community/blob/main/sig-analytics/prd.md) be part of deliverables? which would be difficult/not possible to address?
- would someone else need to host an archival node?

Zack:
- looking for someone else to host archive node but could host if absolutely necessary
- indexer is a general solution for Cosmos chains, not built specifically for any one network
- looking to query providers rather than general blockchain nodes - still working on structure, hasn't queried enough yet
- archive node would need to go back to genesis if looking for all time data
- indexers likely began breaking once [State Sync](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/v0.34.x/spec/abci/apps.md#state-sync) came out as full nodes no longer had transaction history

Cheng:
- would be nice to have all-time data but could go back to most recent mainnet

Zack:
- if all info was stored in the genesis file of the most recent chain, we can have a job to initially extract metrics, load, and proceed

Tyler:
- Andre from Overclock has [instructions on syncing a node at height 0](https://gist.github.com/andy108369/9da91c585500cecc4e4521f49044de15)

Action Items:
- Building out an indexer with archival node that can be used by community
- Zack to build out how indexer will operate: timeline, diagrams
