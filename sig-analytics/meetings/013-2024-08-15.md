## **Meeting Notes**

**Introduction and Overview of the Analytics Interest Group (Tyler Wright)**
- Tyler Wright introduced the meeting as part of the ongoing efforts of the Analytics Interest Group.
- He highlighted the group's historical focus on developing an open-source indexer solution, which is now available as open-source.
- Tyler mentioned that updates on the indexer and other relevant topics would be discussed, with community feedback encouraged.
- He informed participants that information from the index service is available on [stats.Akash.network](https://stats.akash.network/) for tracking and monitoring.

**Updates on the Open-Source Indexer Solution (Maxime Cyr)**
- Maxime Cyr provided an update on recent changes to the indexer:
  - The team added tracking for persistent storage alongside FML storage. Currently, persistent storage is combined in the UI, but it will be separated into its own graph in the future.
  - The retry interval for time checks on providers was reduced, enabling providers to come back online sooner after a failure.
  - A small bug was found and fixed in the indexer, which affected only 0.0001% of the value, having no significant impact on the statistics.
- Tyler Wright asked Maxime Cyr to share a [link](https://github.com/akash-network/console/tree/main/apps/indexer) where people can track these changes for visibility.

**Community Feedback and Discussion (Tyler Wright, Maxime Beauchamp)**
- Tyler Wright shared feedback from a Telegram user regarding the daily USD chart on the stats page:
  - The user mentioned that the chart appears "messy" in the all-time view, and the 30-day view is too short.
  - The suggestion was made to add a 90-day view and improve zoom-out functionality for easier viewing.
- Maxime Beauchamp acknowledged the feedback and mentioned that an issue had been created to address these concerns.
  - He suggested that updating the graph library could improve chart functionality and invited community members to contribute to this effort.
  - Maxime emphasized the importance of aligning on the library choice and implementation, and encouraged community involvement.

**Discussion on Meeting Frequency (Tyler Wright, Maxime Beauchamp)**
- Tyler Wright asked if there were any additional topics or updates that needed to be covered before concluding the meeting.
- Maxime Beauchamp brought up the possibility of changing the meeting frequency from bi-monthly to monthly.
- After a brief discussion, it was clarified that "bi-monthly" means every two months, and the current schedule would remain unchanged.
- Tyler Wright mentioned that the decision to keep the meetings every two months was based on the current level of updates and contributions, but they could revisit the frequency if needed.

**Open Floor for Additional Topics (Tyler Wright)**
- Tyler Wright encouraged participants to bring up any final topics or updates.
- He emphasized the importance of community involvement and reminded attendees to use Telegram and Discord for ongoing discussions.
- Tyler offered to organize one-off working group sessions for those interested in contributing more actively to the indexer or other projects.

**For Maxime Cyr:**
- Share the link to track recent changes to the indexer for visibility among the group.

**For Maxime Beauchamp:**
- Continue working on improving the chart functionality, including adding a 90-day view and zoom-out features.
- Support and engage with the community regarding contributions to the indexer and other analytics-related projects.

**For Tyler Wright:**
- Facilitate any one-off working group sessions as needed for community members interested in contributing more actively.
- Ensure that meeting notes and resources are shared with the community to encourage involvement.

**For All Participants:**
- Stay engaged with the analytics Discord channel and other platforms to provide feedback and suggestions for future meetings and projects.
