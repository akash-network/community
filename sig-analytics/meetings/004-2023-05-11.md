## Notes

Max:
- Big Query obstacles are small challenges (lots of data but cannot give specifics as others are working on it), cost
- Started writing a proposal to get funded for work, also including PRD from previous proposal - will post proposal today/tomorrow
- Sample of analytics from Cloudmos database is not available but will include blocks, transactions, all stats gathered using indexer since genesis block. Data can then be joined between entities to calculate specific stats
- Can show database schema in sig-analytics channel, current priority is the proposal
- Cloudmos will not initially open-source the indexer, Anil mentioned open-sourcing could be a means of mitigating cost by allowing others to host archival node

Tyler:
- Numia and Subquery have been explored
- Andre put a path forward for creating an archival node specifically for Subquery, details in sig-analytics channel

Anil:
- Indexer and archival node are needed regardless of data source
- GPU testnet has been and will be the current focus. If there is no good option for an indexer once complete, will work on it ourselves and open-source it
- May look at putting a bounty for hosting an archival node - will need a separate instance
- Any indexer will need to be able to perform specific types of queries - closed-source could be limited but Max stated Big Query should be able to address needs

- Messari put a proposal in sig-analytics, presently open for comment

Action Items:

- Max will continue work with Big Query and post a funding proposal for discussion
- Max to post database schema in sig-analytics channel
