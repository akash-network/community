## **Participants**


## Notes

- Anil mentioned that the PRD covers all of the [desired metrics](https://github.com/akash-network/community/blob/main/sig-analytics/prd.md#desired-metrics-question-they-answer), leveraging data from on chain, and other sources (i.e. Praetor, Cloudmos, etc)
- The onchain data model is specifically for pulling data on chain. 
- Anil gave a progress report that the Overclock team is looking at indexer options. The first option is Numia, and then the group will explore if Cloudmos path is another option. 
- Anil asked if there were any questions on the [PRD - Growth Analytics for Akash Network](https://github.com/akash-network/community/blob/main/sig-analytics/prd.md) or [[WIP] Data Model for on Chain Data (Akash Network) Analysis](https://github.com/akash-network/community/blob/main/sig-analytics/onchain-data-model.md).
- Jin talked about the progress he is working on. 
- The numia output, if that route is taken, will chain the on-chain model.
- Jin asked Max from Cloudmos what Txs or attributes they use for closed leases. 
- Max mentioned that it is up to the provider to close the lease. Cloudmos counts uakt by block. That is how they find akt spend for a deployment. 
- Cloudmos looks at the original deposit and calculates. 
- Jin gave another update on Numia. Their indexer stopped indexing December 2022. 
- Max and Cloudmos has done the work that Jin is working on. 
- Max shared the [Akashlytics data medium post](https://medium.com/p/862c5c41dd38).
- Anil asked if the plan was to open source the database or provide an API for community to used. Max answered that if their funding proposal is successful, the databases will be made open source. 
- Anil mentioned another company called subquery. May need an archival node for this path.
- Anil mentioned that some of the work needed for the provider data will need to come from the work that Praetor. 
- Jigar started working on databases for past and future leases. The group can access API if needed. 
- Anil mentioned that there is no storing and caching of historical data for providers right now. 
- Jigar mentioned that Praetor only stores last 30 days of data. If there is a need for more historical data, Jigar and Praetor can open that up as well. 
- As Jin investigates on chain data,
- Anil asked if the data needs to be in one database. 
- Max and cloudmos started doing provider snapshots.
- Another sig-analytics member, Superfish, is building an indexer for Akash and other changes. Update will be shared on discord or at a future sig-analytics monthly meeting. 


### Action Items

- Participants should look at medium post on how Max and Cloudmos calculate data on Akash Network. 
- Jin is continuing to look at Numia and get data back online after December 2022.
