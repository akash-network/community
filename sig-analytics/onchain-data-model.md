# [WIP] Data Model for on Chain Data (Akash Network) Analysis

The goal of this document is to summarize data requirements for on-chain data, pulled from the Akash Network blockchain, to help answer many of the questions called out in the [PRD](prd.md). There is no specific reference to data store here, as that will be an implementation decision.

This is a work-in-progress [WIP] that will be fleshed out more as we think through the schema.

## Tables 

### Tables Summary

The following tables have been identified at this time and connected to the [specific metrics](prd.md) they will provide data for. The next section goes into the structure (schema) of these tables.
