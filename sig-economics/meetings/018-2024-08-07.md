## Meeting Notes
### Introduction and Previous Meeting Review

- Scott Hewitson welcomed attendees and those who may watch the video later
- Last month's meeting was brief (about 15 minutes) and covered PIP updates and the inflation proposal

### Current Proposals

#### Inflation Update Proposal

- Cheng Wang provided a detailed update:
  - Originally proposed to reduce inflation and increase community tax
  - Initial proposal suggested increasing community pool tax from 20% to 40% (or 10% to 40%, exact figures not recalled)
  - After community feedback, the proposal was modified to only adjust inflation
  - Reducing inflation would also result in a reduction of APR for staking
  - The new inflation rate is set to take effect the day after the meeting
  - Reasons for the adjustment:
    - Community pool is well-funded despite recent market volatility
    - Current emissions are ahead of the original schedule
  - The community pool tax increase was removed from the proposal due to community pushback
  - Original goal was to have community pool tax at roughly 50%
  - Community suggested separating inflation parameter adjustment from community pool adjustments
  - Spreadsheet calculations now take into account staking ratios for more accurate projections

#### Developer Onboarding Funding Proposal

- Referred to as "Developer onboarding funding proposal number two"
- Robert is running this proposal, which is a continuation of a successful version one
- The proposal is currently on-chain and open for voting
- Scott encouraged those who haven't voted to do so

### Provider Incentive Program (PIP) Update

- Cheng Wang provided a comprehensive update on PIP:
  - PIP One Phase One is nearing completion
  - PIP One launched in February of the current year
  - Major initiatives funded by the community pool in 2024:
    - PIP One Phase One (approximately 3 million tokens, or $3-4 million at the time)
    - Coinbase Learn and Earn program (about $7 million)
  - Final funds from PIP One are being committed, including for new H100 GPUs
  - Detailed reporting and invoicing are being prepared for transparency
  - Spreadsheet updated to take into account staking ratios for accurate calculations
  - Challenges with implementing the liquidity pool phase due to the need for verified resources
    - Concerns about potential spoofing of resources (e.g., fake H100 GPUs) by scammers
  - PIP Two discussions to begin in the coming 3-6 weeks
  - PIP One had three phases: committed phase, liquidity pool phase, and R&D phase
  - PIP Two will likely focus on another committed batch
  - Learnings from PIP One will be applied to PIP Two

### Zealy Campaign Update

- Robert Del Rey discussed the ongoing Zealy campaign:
  - Aims to increase participation in SIGs and working groups
  - Extra XP points offered for attending calls like sig-economics
  - XP points can be exchanged for AKT
  - Secret word can be submitted even if heard from the recording
