## Meeting Notes

- **Provider Incentives Update:**
  - Scott mentioned the progress on the provider incentives dashboard, which is almost complete.
  - Action item: Scott to finalize the dashboard in the next few days.

- **Coinbase Learn:**
  - Over 500,000 activations achieved.
  - Current budget is still substantial, with future campaigns and quests planned.
  - Discussion on the translation of these activations on-chain and the strategy to encourage long-term holding through a staking quest with the Keplr team.

- **Tenant Incentives:**
  - No significant progress on tenant and Sonos.
  - Discussion on potential pilot programs to incentivize tenant deployment.
  - Update on oWce fixing, allowing for easier deployment.

- **DAODAO and Cosmos Wasm Integration:**
  - Nick Merrill's proposal to add Cosmos Wasm to Akash for community pool tokens vesting and other functionalities.
  - Current focus on core functionality; smart contracts integration is a lower priority.

- **Inflation and Staking Percentages:**
  - Discussion about recent Discord discussions on inflation and staking percentages.
  - Current APR is approximately 20%, with inflation around 19%.
  - Props 240 and 241 adjusted inflation parameters and increased the community pool tax.
  - Concerns about high inflation leading to sell pressure and negative price action.
  - Scott to run some numbers and continue the discussion in Discord and the next call.
  - Discussion on estimated time to reach market cap with current inflation parameters.
  - Current projection: September 2030 at 344 million tokens, cap at 388 million.
  - Community pool tax (40% of inflation) ensures tokens are locked and released only through governance proposals.
  - Emphasis on maintaining a decentralized approach to managing the community pool for long-term health.

- **Proposal Discussion:**
  - Jeremy from Shade Protocol suggested funding a pool on Shade to enable secret AKT transactions.
  - Rodri shared his experience with AKT transactions on the Secret dashboard, which were not working in December.
  - Scott emphasized the importance of community input and thorough testing before moving forward with proposals.
  - Encouragement for Rodri to share his experience in the discussion for better context.

- **Inflation and Token Dynamics:**
  - Sean Morris raised a question about the average tenant lease period, which led to a broader discussion about the need for more detailed metrics to understand token economics better.
  - Scott mentioned the importance of tracking lease periods to understand the market dynamics and stickiness of tenant leases.
  - Sean was advised to check Sig Analytics for any existing metrics and potentially raise the question there for further analysis.

- **Additional Listings for AKT:**
  - Andrew Gnatyuk asked about the strategy for additional listings of AKT on exchanges.
  - Scott emphasized the trade-offs involved in paying for listings and the focus on organic growth.
  - Scott mentioned that paying for listings is generally not prioritized, focusing on organic growth and meaningful integrations.
  - Major centralized exchanges like Kraken have listed AKT without solicitation, showing organic interest.
  - Dex listings are considered case by case, with emphasis on meaningful integrations that provide real value to the ecosystem.

- **Proposals and Community Involvement:**
  - Tyler Wright highlighted the importance of community input in discussions around inflation and staking percentages.
  - Acknowledged the global nature of the community and the challenge of aligning meeting times across different time zones.
  - Encouraged ongoing discussions in Discord and Sig Analytics for broader community engagement.

**Closing Remarks:**

- Tyler Wright noted the importance of following up on inflation discussions in Discord to ensure inclusivity of community members in different time zones.
