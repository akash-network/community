## Notes

- Cheng talked about the proposal that recently passed. This proposal is proposal 211 https://www.mintscan.io/akash/proposals/211. Cheng asked if anyone had any questions.
- The community pool tax will be raised to 25% and inflation min raised to 8% to grow the community pool and ensure it is properly funded for provider and deployer incentives.
- Mainnet upgrade is coming up and take pay and stable payments will be up and running.
- Core team is working on a visualization for helping people understanding how AKT 2.0 will affect the AKT token.
- Cheng wanted to make sure that multi currency support will not in any way shape of form deterioate the utility of AKT. Any added currencies will have a take rate associated with it.
- Take rate will feeed into incentive pools, for bootstrapping the network, free trials, etc.
- Take rate is also going to the security budget of AKT. Another part of securing the blockchain comes from the take rate.
- Andrew asked if users can see stats on mintscan to see the stats for the pools. Cheng said that this will be all on chain, simnilar to Osmosis.
- Andrew asked about USDC. Cheng mentioned that the route to get USDC is hard right now. In the future, it will get better.
- New currencies will be added after the mainnet upgade. Two governance proposals will have to be submitted and voted on. The two currencies will be USDT via Kava. IST will be the second currency.
- Julius asks what happens if one of the underlying Assets of IST depegs? Cheng says that it is up to IST.
- The asset will not be stable anymore, but this was not change the Akash Marketplace.
- As the network grows, the need to deliniate use paths for pools needs to be developed. Right now, a catch all in the community pool is just fine.
- Andrew asked if there will be a governance proposal for all new pools being developed. Cheng says "100 percemt". Unless there is a genesis proposal that are automated, anything new will be a new proposal voted on by the community.
- Cheng talked about a rough idea that is kind of like creating an order book. This will allow tenants and providers to request resources and alottment for all.



### Notable Questions (Paraphrased)

- Andrew asked if the 8% minimum is going to decrease over time? Cheng said that there is no plan to change this. The primary reason for the proposal was to increase community pool tax from 10% to 25%. If there are requests to change inflation percentage, then they will have to go up for a vote. There are a number of hypothetical scenarios that can affect inflation.

- Andrew asked about the acquistion of Cloudmos. If the community does not want to support giving 200k to Overclock Labs, what then? Cheng mentioned that the proposal went on discussions so that the community can give feedback. If there are concerns, Overclock Labs will try to solve for those concerns.
- Andrew asked about paid features that were coming to Cloudmos. Will these paid features be coming to the new strategy. There are some examples of paid services for both providers and tenants, but these items have not been fully fledged out yet. The focus right now is on adoption and user experience to get users engaging with the Akash Network as often as possible.
