## Meeting Notes

### Opening Remarks

* Tyler Wright welcomed participants to the first SIG Economics meeting of 2026.
* January discussions were primarily handled in steering committees under a condensed schedule.
* Agenda focused on BME progress, PIP 3.5 updates, and broader economic initiatives.

---

## Burn Mint Equilibrium Update

### Overview and Purpose

* Cheng Wang reiterated that BME realigns value capture directly with compute consumption.
* BME restores AKT as the canonical in-and-out asset for the network.
* Previous stable payment implementations required complex IBC routing and were suboptimal.
* Market maturity of AKT liquidity is significantly stronger than during the original stable payment rollout.

### Incentivized Testnet Phasing

* Core team has been internally testing BME for several weeks and fixing discovered bugs.
* A private group of trusted insiders has begun structured pre-testnet validation.
* Timeline for public incentivized testnet expected next week.
* Testnet duration estimated at two to three weeks.

### Testing Phases

* BME logic must be tested in isolation.
* Circuit breaker mechanism must be tested independently.
* Circuit breakers simulate extreme price volatility by manually injecting price changes.
* Smart contract component that validates oracle price feeds must also be tested separately.
* Final phase merges BME logic and oracle smart contract for full integration testing.

### Risk Mitigation

* Circuit breakers prevent runaway economic instability during sharp price drops.
* Minted compute token is non-transferable, reducing systemic risk.
* In extreme cases, settlement can default back to AKT-only mode.

---

## PIP 3.5 Modification Update

### Context

* Proposal passed on-chain recently.
* Modification driven by strong demand for H100 and H200 GPU resources.
* High-demand production-grade GPUs prioritized over lower-utilization allocations.

### Stewardship

* Isaac Grooms emphasized responsible fund reallocation.
* Any unused funds from prior PIP programs historically returned to the community pool.
* Resources are targeted toward production clients scaling on the marketplace.

---

## Reflexivity Research Proposal

* Discussion around reflexivity research funding.
* Community consensus that focus should remain on driving marketplace usage.
* Proposal will be tabled and potentially revisited later in the year.

---

## Growth Marketing Proposal Retrospective

### Financial Outcome

* Less than 50% of allocated budget was used.
* Remaining funds returned to the community pool.
* Initiative was paused in December.

### Wins

* Website redesign and branding improvements.
* Improved enterprise sales infrastructure and lead tracking.
* Hiring of enterprise sales leadership.
* Improved PR firm partnership and positioning clarity.
* Better understanding of market gaps and customer expectations.

### Lessons Learned

* Attempted to accelerate growth before product readiness.
* Missing enterprise-grade features such as VMs and log forwarding limited conversion.
* Strategic shift toward strengthening core infrastructure before scaling outreach.
* Decision described as “cart before the horse.”

---

## AI Hackathons & Ecosystem Positioning

* Andrew raised question about participation in AI agent hackathons.
* Cheng outlined pivot toward developer-centric events and hackathons.
* Focus shifted from large crypto conferences to targeted builder events.
* Akash ML and abstraction layers such as AkashML and Home Node improve accessibility.
* Home Node reduces provider variability and abstracts operational complexity.

---

## Provider Reliability & Failover Discussion

### Automatic Redeployment Concept

* Question raised about automatic failover if provider goes offline.
* Community confirmed technical feasibility but acknowledged complexity.

### Angela Steffens Perspective

* Protocol-level orchestration currently not designed for automatic failover.
* Angela’s team handles orchestration off-chain using centralized tracking.
* Kubernetes-based orchestration systems could enable seamless scaling.
* On-chain orchestration would introduce additional latency.
* Deepen systems inherently carry latency tradeoffs.
* Enterprise-level scaling and GitHub-based template deployment targeted for this year.

### Key Insight

* Adding failover logic on-chain may not be financially or technically optimal.
* Centralized orchestration layers can provide practical solutions while maintaining decentralized compute.

---

## Builder Spotlight — Angela Steffens

* Angela’s team has been building on Akash in stealth for one year.
* Infrastructure spans Akash, Arweave, Filecoin, and IPFS.
* Built UX-focused deployment abstraction similar to Railway.
* AI startups face unsustainable centralized cloud costs once credits expire.
* Deepen economics make agentic systems financially viable.
* Team exiting stealth and planning more public engagement.

---

## Multi-Chain Expansion RFP

* Andrew asked about chain expansion discussions.
* Cheng confirmed internal review team evaluating RFP responses.
* Responses vary in quality and seriousness.
* Final shortlist emerging.
* Criteria and rubric will be shared with community before final decision.
* Ultimate decision remains community-driven.

---

## Closing Remarks

* Tyler thanked participants and emphasized importance of builder feedback.
* Notes, transcript, and recording will be published to GitHub.
* Newsletter will include roundup of all SIG updates.
* Community encouraged to provide feedback on meeting times and structure.
* Meeting adjourned after approximately 50 minutes.

## Transcript


Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG Economics. It's Wednesday, February 4th, 2026. During the special interest group for economics, the Akash community comes together to talk about all things related to the economics of Akash the AKT token and a number of other initiatives. I think this is the first state economics meeting of 2026. we've had a number of steering committees in a sort of structured and condensed schedule for January. But really looking forward to the sig economics call today.

Tyler Wright: there are a number of things that we talked about at the last economics call I think as a part of the agenda including BME I know there's been some initial internal testing with some folks in the Akash community around the incentivized test net and we'll get an update on where things are some of the next steps from Chang and others. I know that there was a PIP 3.5 proposal that went up discussion a number of weeks ago and then passed on chain believe yesterday. so we can see if there's any questions or any followup there. and then if there's any other topics that anybody wants to make sure get discussed as it pertains to economics, feel free to drop them in the agenda or in the chat rather and we can add them to the agenda.

Tyler Wright: All I guess I'll start off by handing it over to Chang. I know we've talked about the BME steps in a number of other SIGs over the last month. again, the core team has been doing testing of smart contracts and BME internally for about three or four weeks. found a number of bugs and those bugs are continuing to be rectified and again environment is continuing to change. As of this past weekend, there have been a number of folks in the community. Big shout out to Joe Deng, the AkashH community manager for helping to facilitate and bring some of those folks together.

Tyler Wright: But there's been a private group of trusted Akash insiders that have been helping to test out initial phases of what the incentivized test net would look like as well as the submission form to make sure s specific tests. again the process is as buttoned up as possible prior to again a wider more marketed launch. so there's been a great lot of great feedback that has come from that. I know there's again some other things that are happening in the background as it pertains to again continuing a fixing of some of the bugs that have been brought up by core team and by some other folks. But I know Chang has been continuing to follow along and map out what the next steps are as it pertains to BME incentivized test net.

Tyler Wright: I think we want to take some time to talk about the incentivized test net center or just see if anybody has any additional thoughts or questions about the AE in general …

Tyler Wright: for burn mint equilibrium. And I'll drop that just in case as a reference point, but Chang feel free to, talk about maybe where we are right now after some initial thoughts and

Cheng Wang: Yeah. Yeah.

Cheng Wang: Absolutely. Thank you for the intro, Tai, and wonderfully covered as always. So, for those of you who forget, right, BME is something we talked about for a long time. and it's one of the things that at its highest level really is the value alignment and value capture of relative to compute consumption right so that's the simplest terms so I think this implementation brings everything core central back to AKT historically when we first launched for example stable payments and things like that via USCC the version of it that we have

Cheng Wang: is not optimal, right? Because it has to jump through all these IBC hoops with Squid Router does make things easier. But the Burman equilibrium kind of function that we're introducing to a Kosh network is going to restore AKT as kind of the canonical in and out for Akash network.  So that's going to be great in addition to and at this point in time the markets have developed significantly even though markets are in complete utter chAkash right now.

Cheng Wang: But when I say that it's I think broadly AKT as far as the markets that support it right is way order magnitude stronger now than it was when we first introduced stable payments what three years ago almost I want to say and yeah so there we go discount the buy dip baby if it dips anymore I won't have any more discounts to discount powder's dry baby but yeah so that's the general premise


### 00:05:00

Cheng Wang: of VME and then not the premise but the purpose of BME right and where we're at now is the core team like I said is working with a bunch of insiders to really flesh out all the kind of minutia from the tasks to how they're ordered to what's going to be covered in these things for the incentivized test net and designing it so that it is maximumly it's easy to approach easy to understand because this thing is going to be highly technical right like I won't be able to participate

Cheng Wang: in this test and even if I wanted to I'm simply just not technical enough. Maybe with Claude or GBC I might be able to do something right but for by and large it's going to be highly technical. So we want to make sure it's framed and designed really well and that the requisite prizes for each completion or each thing or each issue found is commiserate with the problem discovered. So that's kind of where we are now. the court team will likely publish a timeline sometime probably next week as far as the incentivized test net launch goes. and it will probably last somewhere in the realm of two to three weeks somewhere in that range. and the reason being for it is because there are a bunch of components that need to be tested in isolation separately and then together. So there are two big pieces.

Cheng Wang: There's the burn mint equilibrium part of the co of the code that needs to be tested on its own. So the burning of ACT to create a AKT again, right? That process holistically needs to be tested in on its own. And then there's the circuit breaker mechanisms, right? That has to be tested in isolation as well.  And so when the circuit breakers as you guys recall there's a certain collateralization ratio that has to be maintained relative to AKT if that falls below a certain threshold like the circuit breaker mechanisms kind of set in right I forget what the specifics are at this moment in time but and so anyway the circuit breaker needs to be tested in the first part reason for that is circuit breaker will only trigger if there's significant changes in

Cheng Wang: price, right? And so the only way to simulate that is to fake the price. So manually input a significant change in prices to simulate what would happen in real life. And so that's the man that manual intervention can only be done in isolation within a test Second component that the core team is working on concurrently with the BME specific component is the smart contract component. Right?  So the smart contract component is really important to feed the price into Akash network from various sources and to essentially be able to check and validate that those sources are correctly signed by the right people. So for example, PIT network is simply network that grabs the prices right and the validators all sign put their stamp of approval on it so that the prices are valid essentially by the security of that particular chain.

Cheng Wang: and so the smart contract that pulls in this information needs to go in and check whether or not that information is indeed signed by The validators are who they say they are and all this kind of stuff, There's a lot of nuances in there. And so that is a separate thing that has to be tested onto itself. I'm not sure yet if that will be embedded into a phase two of the testing in isolation. TBD on that partic that side of things. I don't know yet, right?

Cheng Wang: there's not much like the that requires user interaction on this side of things but once that part is tested then the two need to be merged together and tested completely souped to nuts once again right so when BME is live with a price oracle that pulls in from the smart contract that's the full kind of edition if you final form of BME will be brought to bear and that will be kind of the phase

Cheng Wang: two, if you will, or three maybe of the incentivized test net. And so that's why, there's going to be sequencing that's going to come along. And the sequencing is defined by the two major batches of features, if that will be tested in isolation. And then the final phase will be to merge these two things together in order to test that in a cohesive fashion at the end. So that's where BME is. I know a bit long-winded, but that's where we are.  Any questions, comments?

Tyler Wright: Perfect. Thank you very much, Chang. and again, I appreciate everybody from the core team and the community that's been involved in kind of getting us to this point and testing things, giving feedback, thoughts. So, much appreciate All right. we will continue to track just like we do a number of the PIP programs. during the SIG economics call again this proposal went up was discussed I think in the last s economics meeting in December. U what it kind of looked like was developed from there. there was some discussion online and then the proposal passed on chain today. I just want to see if there's any questions or additional feedback.


### 00:10:00

Tyler Wright: I know again from my perspective as a part of the core team I know that this decision around the kind of modification for 3.5 was based upon a great deal of demand that has been coming in for again some of the H1 A100s which is why there's been a change in kind of where the resources are coming from.  I know B200's is a GP resource that is capable of working on the Akash network marketplace but some of the resources have come off or even prior to that there's been a number of folks that overclock labs or key members of the community have relationships with that are consist consistently asking for hey do you have any more H200s there's no available resources or H100s and so again

Tyler Wright: to meet up with the demand. as you know, one of the things that the Akash community has talked about for a long time is really continuing to drive demand, dive usage across network marketplace. that was the methodology and thought process but be behind again the modification to PIP 3.5. we'll continue to again as a core team who's facilitating this kind of monitor and answer any questions or give updates as it pertains to the usage of the funds. I know that again in past PIT programs any funds that weren't used or were recouped or returned to the community pool.

Tyler Wright: But I just wanted to again quickly outline and I'm sure Chang and Isaac can also provide perspective, but I just wanted to provide some perspective as to a little bit background on PIP 3.5 and the thought process from the core team. Sorry Isaac, I know that you were again instrumental in bringing that all to pass. I didn't mean to take your thunder, but just wanted to provide some additional context.  I don't know if you have anything you want to add.

Isaac Grooms: Hey, no, you covered a lot of it. yeah, really just the whole priority here is making sure we're being good stewards of the funds that we have. shifting available funds one available or in demand resources. and then anything that's been a shortfall, any sort of budget constraints that we have, we just want to make sure that's covered and, that these resources are available to community members.  So that's the whole idea. But yeah, you did a great job covering it. I appreciate it.

Tyler Wright: And again, I know there was a little bit of discussion these are resources that are usually used by clients in production setting less so for pre-trial purposes or that kind of usage.

Tyler Wright: this is again high demand resources that customers are paying for on the marketplace so just validating towards growth these companies are continuing to scale and again are always looking for new resources

Cheng Wang: let's see CN L model… how sensitive  Is the model going to be to sharp price drops? Is the idea that the vault and circuit breakers also are breaking settlement providers? Yeah. So the vault is there to ensure that there's a sufficient balance. and that's something that'll be obviously updated over time as well.  And then if there is a dramatic price drop exactly if there's some sort of potential flaw or some sort of black swan event, the circuit breaker is there to ensure that things don't run away. and it's further mitigated by the fact that the act that is minted the compute token is not transferable. So it can only be used for compute.

Cheng Wang: 

Cheng Wang: Right there are historically other places that use BME where one of the biggest flaws beyond that not having circuit breaker is of course the stable coin if you will that is being minted is widely transferable and market and can be sold and bought. Right. So that's one big thing there. But yes, you're 100% there. it is there to ensure that if things do hit the fan there's not a runaway effect that we can't foresee or some that we can and to ensure that settlement stays stable as well and…


### 00:15:00

Tyler Wright: What? s***.

Cheng Wang: of course one thing if the circuit breaker does trip settlement can continue I believe I'm like 4% sure that AKT will be the default fallback.

Tyler Wright: Anyone have any other questions about Bernment equilibrium?

Cheng Wang: So you can still settle from AKT to AKT skipping over the actment part

Tyler Wright: again the upcoming incentivized test net or anything as it pertains to the PIP program or any other quickly while we're on the topic of discussions, I know that I don't believe the person that put the discussion is here. but I will just talk about it real fast.

Tyler Wright: Again, I have not heard from this group specifically, but just in the nature of continuing as a community to give feedback to anybody that comes in, please there is a discussion I think touches sig economics that if anybody has any opinions about, feel free to drop them in that discussion. I think at the last SIG economics meeting there was a group reflexivity research that was talking about looking for some community pool funding to do some research or a kind of documentation that gets shared with their wide array of folks that are across investors and I think they have a network of media resources.

Tyler Wright: I think the community and the core team talked about it a great deal and have determined that this is probably not the right time for this kind of proposal. I think the focus should be on driving items that again increase usage of the network. so the team behind that proposal is going to table that proposal for some time and maybe come back to the Akash community in the summer and see if the appetite has changed.  So, I just want to get some feedback on and some updates on that proposal as well. Go ahead, Andrew G.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Yeah. Hey guys. I hope you're all good. just wanted to ask about we had some proposal if I can recall about the marketing and that we spent bunch of money to do some marketing stuff across all the globe. how is that going? basically just wanted to know cuz I've been out of the loop recently and…

Andrew Gnatyuk: just want to know if that's providing us some good stats because Yeah.

Cheng Wang: Yeah, that's a great question.

Cheng Wang: Actually so a lot of I think the remaining budget so as of end of the year last year the experiment that we were I guess the effort or the initiative that we undertook with the group that we were working with simply was not working out well and so we did have gains that we made in terms of setting up the infrastructure.

Cheng Wang: So just to be brutally frank and honest with everyone, I think we all deserve that. So the overall assessment is I don't think it worked Number one. why didn't it work I can kind of dive into some of the details. So any excess funds I think Isaac please just correct me if I'm wrong have already been returned to the community pool. and so that's where it currently stand. the initiatives that were taken on in that original scope was not renewed and…

Cheng Wang: we're not going to request a second trunch obviously. bulls going up for that. go ahead Ty, do you want to jump in?

Tyler Wright: Yeah, just real quick,…

Tyler Wright: I also want to say from a …

Cheng Wang: Yeah. Sorry.

Tyler Wright: because Chang, I would like you to continue on with the conversations you're having about just how it went. but there was a number of deliverables that Dennis was able to get that we talked about the last SIG design meeting. I'll drop the chat in there. But whether it be from branding materials to analytics about kind of information we got from email marketing campaigns and some of We have a set deliverable that we talked about in the last sig design meeting. but I do want Chang to talk a little bit more about how we think that went in the kind of the macro level. I just want to chime in, Andrew, and I'll share that in the chat, but make sure that you have access to it just to look at the actual deliverables from that growth marketing proposal program.


### 00:20:00

Cheng Wang: appreciate Yeah, exactly So, there were areas that definitely I think What were the wins? so I think the wins number one understanding it through this exercise I think we better understood our kind of place in the market where are the gaps were so that's one of the kind of silver linings of this particular process that was one second part was a lot of the website redesigns and things like that and refactoring that helped a lot I like Tyler just mentioned.

Cheng Wang: Third is in terms of our ability to do basically enterprise sales that entire apparatus with regards to lead tracking, lead generation, all this kind of stuff. be able to parse those things out and get into the flow of actually talking to potential customers to bring them into Akash that's ramped up and that infrastructure was non-existent previously. We were trying to do this thing with navigators,  there's kind of like a mly crew of folks from the community who wanted to help along with some internal part-time resources to put together kind of a sales force if you will and now we have something far more fleshed out and an enterprise salesperson at the helm to really drive this stuff right and there are a lot of these things already in the works we can't share some of the detailings of that because it's all under NDA and these they don't mess around right so we have to kind of sit on those things so these are the wins  that have been brought to bear.

Cheng Wang: In addition to that, the new kind of PR firm that we're working with now is I think a significant improvement with the previous one and that was a benefit that came out of the work that this group has done and the PR firm I'm talking about we're continuing to work through today and where that is going to benefit us over the long run is helping Akash really crystallize and define its position in a way where historically we were a bit handwavy. so now it's really getting down to the nitty-gritty and the specifics, right? we're the premier marketplace for decentralized compute, right? Okay, what does that actually mean? and how do we actually sell that to different audiences, right? Because the marketplace is saturated. how do we cut through the noise and how do we demonstrate what a cause is capable? So, all of these things are really, really important to the benefits that came out of these are some of I think the key wins.

Cheng Wang: I'm sure I'm missing something. But I think where were the Wins and losses. The losses were we try to supercharge growth, And at a point in time when the network wasn't ready for super growth, In that there were a lot of things that we need to work out. For example,  Why has VMs been the huge priority now on the road map right to build out because that's one of the areas where as we talked to more and more and more customers that became a huge component right that we needed huge feature that we needed to supplement. so these were learnings that we kind of brought from the experience of doing this particular program.

Cheng Wang: but yeah, just I think overall we're in position right now to leverage the expense that entire apparatus was. and there's just a lot more that we can do with the network as it currently stands, to really improve our capabilities before we jump into the next phase. So in short, cart before the horse kind of moment, we try to fly before we can run and we need to get to running,  speed before we can really try to take off. So I think that's where we're at now. the previous meeting we had what was it the steering committee was like what does Akash expect?

Cheng Wang: How many customers do we expect to gain, And that's one of the key questions is we need to flesh out the essential features. log forwarding, all these things that don't sound very sexy or exciting are absolutely in super critical to retain and build the customer base, to be truly bulletproof. And so that's that the state we're in. And if you try to get way too fancy and say, "Hey, we're ready for everything."  and we go out and we try to sell it to customers and they're like, "Hey, do you guys have VMs?" We're like, not yet." And they're like, "Okay, come talk to us when you have that, right?" So, we're spooled up to address that particular segment of the market in large without having the capabilities to back that up. So, as a result, we need to put that on ice and, focus on the fundamentals to ensure we do that particular area just do the product development really well before we're ready to advance further.


### 00:25:00

Andrew Gnatyuk: Got So basically we spent from the proposal 50% of the money was proposed to us.

Cheng Wang: a little less than 50%.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Okay.

Cheng Wang: Yeah, less than 50%.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Got it.

Cheng Wang: And then that's the reason why we broke it up is just like, hey, if this doesn't work,…

Cheng Wang: we got to systematically pull the plug, yeah, so I think the proposal went through in April, if I'm not mistake and we pulled the plug in December.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Yeah, I got it.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Got Thanks,

Cheng Wang: Yeah, of course.

Tyler Wright: Thank you,…

Tyler Wright: Just want to see if there's any other questions as it pertains to anything SIG economics related. go ahead, Andrew.

Andrew Gnatyuk: So it's not much of  sig economics it's just more of an overall picture. basically so we know that for this month or probably it's February and June there was starting lots of AI agents hackathons when over the open claw is trying to we are setting up lots of open claws and fighting of what's like who the agent is the best in creating startups or some  stuff on the blockchain.

Andrew Gnatyuk: which is basically my question is are we trying or are we looking for the ways to participate in some way as the cheap compute power for the close agents within those hackathons…

Andrew Gnatyuk: because there is one on the salano right now as a break point I'm not saying as a partnerships but maybe like a hype or maybe do some arketing with them or something like

Cheng Wang: Yeah, absolutely.

Cheng Wang: I mean, we're working every angle we possibly can. I mean, example, open claw support network, right? And that's one of the reasons why we've refactored our event strategy so dramatically, Instead of going to a lot of these kind of big tent events, we're honing in specifically on developers and where the developers are and going to hackathons and small ones, right?

Cheng Wang: not like small hack but just hackathons that are smaller not massive events where you just have a booth and whatever and people running about and the yield from that wasn't like it it gives you a lot of good brand awareness and brand presence but where it lacks is qualified leads or qualified users and customers that can come to a network and benefit from everything right so when we go meet the users where they are we get a couple of things one we get users customers right who can people who can develop as potential customers  two people who can develop and add to a Kosh network, and then three is these people all give us a lot of feedback about the product and where things can improve. And so all of these things, really weave together. I know it doesn't answer your question directly, but as concisely as I can say, we're hitting on every possible angle. for example, building out Akash what was that purpose of that?

Cheng Wang: The purpose of that is to say look there are the current architecture of Akash network has limitations with regards to its containerbased architecture right and approach.  So before we give VMs to bear how can we make it more useful for AI users right so you need an abstraction layer to make it useful so people don't have to deal with the complexities underneath right if you're just one or two people tinkering with an AI application you don't necessarily want to deal with all the devops stuff of maintaining infrastructure and running all that stuff right so that's where kind of a bell comes in as an abstraction layer to enable greater utilization on a network resources without the complexity right so

Cheng Wang: to hope to simplify it dramatically. That's where the abstraction comes in. and there are other things we're working on as well to facilitate. But yeah, the Aasha Mal home node is another example of that where as a provider you're coming in, right? it's kind of a catch22, Bringing a provider onto decentralized network. One, you want more providers,  But you don't want providers that are not professional because if I am a developer and I come in and I use resources on the Akash network, I want those resources to be dependable, But if it's just Chang's laptop sitting there and something happens and it's like, your laptop went down. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just a guy. So that's a problem. That's a challenge, right? So Home Node abstracts that away from the end user, right?


### 00:30:00

Cheng Wang: the person who wants to become a provider on Akash network by essentially making it all managed through the overclock labs core team. So it removes that complexity alto together. So then if the any customer has an issue with whatever is running on a particular node of home node right their help person or their contact point is someone on the core team.  the core team can go resolve that issue on behalf of the end user, So there's no need for the individual Chang in his garage to interface with the customer and even need to have the technical knowhow to do so, It abstracts that layer away. So what does that do? It makes it easier to become a provider, albeit in a more sandboxed environment, And you put more constraints around it, but also allows the compute to be a lot more stable, dependable, and have the requisite support behind it to enable it to perform.

Cheng Wang: so all these things are super important because some of the challenges we've seen from customers is like hey my workload went down on this particular provider we don't know who that provider is decentralized network how do we help this is how one way we can kind of limit some of the variability right within the network as far as performance and reliability goes and by limiting the variability but not just limiting it rather  but also raising the floor and raising the ceiling, right?

Andrew Gnatyuk: got it.  And if I may ask one more question purely I'm not a technician but there was an idea in 2021 that would be great for example if provider went down and you had a container there it could automatically be redeployed on another provider and it was cut down due to technical specifics right it wasn't really

Andrew Gnatyuk: much on doable at that time with an AI boom can it be done right now is it technically possible I like as a not technical person I just want to know if we reconsidering this idea that for example if it's on a chain computer and chain computer just went down due to some power outage issue we can just like so there is AI guy that just monitoring the providers and then he just can pull the container and move it to another provider with probably maybe different prices…

Andrew Gnatyuk: but it still could be alerted on the phone for a guy that is running the container and saying are you agreed to pay a bit more but it would be moved to another provider and that's like it yeah that's my

Cheng Wang: Yeah. Yeah.

Cheng Wang: So I don't exactly know where that particular thing sits to be honest.

Cheng Wang: Essentially like Yeah.

Rodri R: I think it's totally possible.

Rodri R: Angela says too, I don't know. I mean,…

Rodri R: it's going to be some work, but I think it's definitely possible.

Cheng Wang: definitely possible.

Cheng Wang: It's essentially a backup, Failover. so yeah, I think I'm not entirely like the implementation I'm not sure how we would do it. It is definitely possible. the team has talked about it.

Cheng Wang: It's definitely a huge thing to do.

Andrew Gnatyuk: I mean the thing is like…

Andrew Gnatyuk: because you said about the professional providers but for example if this thing is possible within a few seconds or a minutes you don't need much of professional providers right right you just need the one that has a good up time Or …

Andrew Gnatyuk: if it's for example some good provider that just went down due to power outages and it can came up within a half an hour you can be on half an hour on another provider just as it is. That's just my point of view.

Cheng Wang: Yeah. No,…

Cheng Wang: no, you're absolutely right.

Angela Steffens: So I can just talk to you a little bit about how I implemented it. We of course are tracking everything outside of the Akash network The protocol itself doesn't support that use case. But we're tracking that in our own database. So that part's not decentralized.  Just realize that although our system is deployed on Akash so it's underlying a decentralized system if you want to think about it that way but we have centralized control over that database just as an important point.

Angela Steffens: we have our own orchestration and the reason behind that was the lack of opensourced since some of the orchestration systems like Terraform recently have gone closed and that was an important decision for us. we're trying very hard not to use anything that's not open in our stack. but there's plenty of Kubernetes orchestration systems that actually handle all of these that would handle it sort of seamlessly.


### 00:35:00

Angela Steffens: our next steps is actually connecting to some of those systems that people are using Terraform to handle orchestration and allow people to scale at what we would, consider sort of an enterprise level. That's a little out a ways for us at least because we're still beta testing on SMBs, right?  So, not too far out though. I mean, at the pace that we're shipping right now, it will definitely be in this year. But again, that's outside the protocol. we would have to make significant underlying protocol changes in order to handle that at a protocol level. which would be great, but it's also a lot of overhead. and I'm not sure it's worth it from a financial standpoint.

Angela Steffens: if I sit down and figure out what the cost would be to do that onchain, I'm not sure it's really worth it. and it would probably be too slow. you have to realize that when you make a decision to go deep anyway, you're already dealing with latency as an issue.  And when you're already dealing with latency as an issue, to add another layer of latency is a significant problem. And so adding that layer back on chain would add an additional layer of latency that would probably be untenable. we're already still working towards full efficiency on the level of latency that we have right now,?

Angela Steffens: how to reduce everything else as much as possible to make the lack of efficiency on using DPEN in the first place something that still feels as close as possible to centralized systems. so our goal was deploys in three minutes right now. we want to get that down to one being able to pull a template from GitHub and deploy it like you can on Railway or Versell or Netlefly in a minute. I think we'll be there because we're already sub three minutes at this point.

Angela Steffens: but I think adding a layer on chain would probably sort of mess that up. and I'm not sure it's entirely worthwhile. because the cost savings you have going to deepen 2 would then also be not as significant if you did the orchestration on chain. if you're handling it in a centralized database we've already solved scaling problems there and efficiency and orchestration so trying to do that all onchain would probably not be great I would say we need the chain to be faster

Angela Steffens: That's just my opinion. Of course, I'm one person. I

Tyler Wright: I love it.

Tyler Wright: This is actually a great segue because is somebody that's been a power user of Akash for some time. I think I met her at an Eth Denver event some time ago. and her and her team have been deploying and building on Akash for a long time in stealth. I've been trying to get them more involved, but at some point, I'm glad to see you here. but, this is somebody again that's been building a lot and building clients. So, I might have you come to sick clients as well, Angela, in the future. But, this is just an example of somebody's building and giving feedback to the core team and the community about things. So, I appreciate you showing up

Angela Steffens: Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it. Yeah, it's been a year since we've been building in stealth on Akash. our system it works very much like railway. we took a lot of the great innovations in DX that Railway sort of implemented and being able to, drag and drop and see your entire stack in one place and on all that sort of stuff. But, right now we're on Akash, Arweave, Filecoin, and, IPFS. We're adding several other networks in the next month. during the beta test we're still in beta test period and working out affiliate programs with centralized providers to connect all the dots.


### 00:40:00

Angela Steffens: We built the system because we were working on agentic platforms and we wanted to deploy on deepen because of the cost savings. We did the math on Google cloud it didn't work. and I think all of the AI startups are going to start finding that once their credits run out. the numbers don't pencil on a lot of agentic systems because of the amount of compute that they take, but they totally pencil on deep pin and that's why we pivoted.  But our ultimate goal was to deploy a bunch of experiments so that we could train a specialized AI in the specific domain of UX, but we couldn't do that in a costefficient way on centralized cloud. we knew that we would run out of credits in no time flat and it just didn't make sense.

Angela Steffens: So we built this layer so that our UX people could easily deploy across the event network. and the core part of our system all of our services are on Akash actually.  So,

Cheng Wang: Thank you.

Tyler Wright: All right.

Tyler Wright: Again, yeah. Yeah. I'm going to make sure that Angela is at the next sick clients meeting and push her to continue to stay involved and be a little bit more public facing. I know they're doing a lot of stuff and stuff, but much appreciated.

Tyler Wright: I know we have just …

Angela Steffens: We're officially not stealthy anymore and…

Angela Steffens: you'll hear lots from us now.

Tyler Wright: cool. I just want to see if there's any other talking points on the economics front that anybody wants to make sure get discussed. real quick, Sandy, I saw your message. I hope I answered it in chat.

Tyler Wright: I think that's great feedback. Again, sometimes we historically did some stuff on spaces and found that managing raising hands and all that kind of stuff was a little bit like hierarchal where with these conversations I could see it's great to see Andrew back because it's just a conversation between community members. I try to help facilitate the conversation with an agenda. but then it's just like people talking about things that are important to them across economics and this SIG and then we have other SIGs around support which we talked about open issues clients we talk about people that are building on top of Akash providers and a whole bunch of other themes.

Tyler Wright: But again, if we need to find different times that accommodate more of the folks that want to get involved in these conversations because we have a community that's based on, every continent damn near, then we should update that. But, much appreciate that feedback. Chang, anything else? I know you usually, have some last minute items after the bell. Is there anything that you have on the economics front?

Cheng Wang: I'm good.

Tyler Wright: Or Andrew, you too. Sometimes as we're about to wrap up, you're like, " I got one more question." Anybody have any other economics questions that they want to talk about? Ben, I know you came late. there was discussion and I'm just providing you some perspective because you're one of the testers.

Tyler Wright: much appreciate again your support in testing out some of the assignments and submission form for the BME incentivized test net again based upon that feedback and some additional items that the core team has found.  The idea is there'll be an update on next steps for BME over by next week and just make sure that everything is cleaned up and optimized for those that'll be participating in incentivized test net. again there'll be some additional testing as well. So Chang mentioned we'll have in the transcript and recording about just breaking this up into phases where things have to be tested by themselves and then things have to be tested in conjunction with one another.

Tyler Wright: So again, Feno, thank you for all your help testing out the instructions. So there'll be some updates across next steps for BME incentivized test net probably next week. Go ahead, Andrew.


### 00:45:00

Andrew Gnatyuk: Yeah so probably the last question for me I know it's not on the short list but I just want to know if there is already formed a group of core team and the community or I don't know insiders that are right now fighting on each which chain are we trying to move and given a thousands of good points or are they we moving to Solana, Ethereum, Avalanche or other or Coinbase maybe?

Andrew Gnatyuk: I don't know.

Cheng Wang: So I can take that on.

Cheng Wang: There's definitely an internal hit squad. just like three people really that is having the initial conversations with so the RFP draft was out and then the full RFP was published. And so that is currently in the phases of we're receiving responses and answering those responses. And some people it's kind of like dating I suppose, right? It's like are you even trying, bro? so there are some responses are those and some that are very detailed. So it takes some time to examine, but we'll definitely update in short order, but I think we're just, so buried with DME and other things right now.

Cheng Wang: But yeah, there are I think just a few final contestants that seem to be really really passionate and strong about their bid essentially, to bring Akash over and that's something that we'll share soon in terms of the criteria, the rubric what like the thinking and the parameters we're in and engage the community wider in this fashion. So it is coming along. it's definitely conversation is ongoing and we have a keen eye on that. So, …

Cheng Wang: fret not. But great question.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Got it. Thank you.

Tyler Wright: and…

Tyler Wright: again it will be ultimately a community decision. So that hit squad as Chang described is just doing a bunch of factf finding and information collection to share with this group and then the wider As Shank mentioned, it's hard to prioritize exploration even though it's very important when we have a number of other features that active people that are using the network are talking about part of the Akash network roadmap. there's so many things going on. So while it is important trying to be strategic on how we handle it so that we can continue to drive demand service folks like Angelo that have issues that could make their experience on their marketplace better.

Cheng Wang: Awesome.

Tyler Wright: So I think that's got to be priority for everybody in the community right now. All right.

Tyler Wright: anything else economics related that anybody wants to make sure gets discussed? Cool. If not, then again I really enjoyed this conversation. I'm going to drive some folks to join some other meetings as well to continue to share some information with different audiences maybe technical audiences and others in the community.

Tyler Wright: Again Sandep if you have any additional feedback about u meeting times or structure please feel free to message myself or Joe or drop a message the insiders channel but great conversation today we'll make sure that the notes and transcription and video are on GitHub again big shout out to George who helps out with that and I know again as a part of the newsletter there'll be roundup of all the six and work in groups how to access the information to make it more accessible for everybody. I'll follow up with some of you all and it's great to see you Andrew. hope all is well on your front with the child and obviously Angela great to see you as well and I'll follow up with everybody. I hope everyone has a great day and…

Tyler Wright: we'll talk soon. Goodbye.

Andrew Gnatyuk: Yep. Thanks,…

Andrew Gnatyuk: guys. Bye. Have a nice day.

Rodri R: You guys.

Cheng Wang: Thank you guys.

Rodri R: Have a nice day.

Angela Steffens: Thanks everyone.

Cheng Wang: Thank you all.

Angela Steffens: You'll see my face a lot more coming up here.

Tyler Wright: Bye-bye.

Rodri R: Hope so.

Cheng Wang: Look forward to it. Amazing. Pleasure to meet your coins,…

Rodri R: Yeah. Yeah.  Idol.

Cheng Wang: Angela. Thank you, J. Bye.
