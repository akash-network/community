## Introduction
[OpenRegistry](https://github.com/containerish/openregistry) is an open source and decentralized container registry which is fully compliant with [OCI Container Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md).
The specification provides similar capabilities as that of the Docker Registry HTTP API V2 protocol.

## Why OpenRegistry?
For the longest time, we have relied on DockerHub to host and distribute our container images (both private and public). OpenRegistry tries to provide a decentralized alternative to that by running a community driven container registry, for People by People.

OpenRegitry uses AkashNetwork as it's compute layer and IPFS/Filebase/Storj for storage. Since AkashNetwork provides a spot like compute market, fault tolerance, Scalability and Resiliency are our priorities from day one.

## Meetings
Discussions and updates will be shared in Akash sig client meetings held monthly
