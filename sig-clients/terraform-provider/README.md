# Client Libraries

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. 

[Terraform Providers](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers) are a logical abstraction of an upstream API. They are responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources from commonly used infrastructure services.

The [Akash Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloud-j-luna/akash/latest/docs) enables Akash Network users to deploy workloads using Terraform. 

To view the source code and open issues visit the [github repository for the Akash Terraform Provider](https://github.com/cloud-j-luna/terraform-provider-akash)
