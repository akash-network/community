  - Proceeded with the agenda, noting two scheduled demos from present participants.

### Piyush Choudhary (Neta DAO Project Demo)
  - Introduced himself and the project aimed at reducing friction in onboarding developers to the Akash Network.
  - Identified the pain points in the current process of deploying GitHub repositories to Akash.
  - Proposed a streamlined process, similar to Vercel, to deploy applications from GitHub to Akash without manual Docker and SDL file creation.
  - Showcased a POC (proof of concept) that automates deployment scripts.
  - Emphasized that the solution will support multiple languages and frameworks, not limited to JavaScript.
  - Demonstrated the automated deployment script detecting changes in the repository and redeploying without manual intervention.
  - Mentioned ongoing discussions and proposals for this concept.

#### Q&A Session on Piyush Demo
- Anil Commented on private repo support being code complete and asked about Piyush's webhooks depending on container image tags.
- Joao Luna asked if the deployed image actively monitors the repository for changes.
- Joao Luna Piyush confirmed that the image checks for updates every five minutes, with plans to use GitHub APIs for real-time updates.
- Scott Sought clarification on the goal of Piyush's solution: 
- Whether it eliminates the need to customize an SDL.
- Whether users need to be knowledgeable about SDL as part of the deployment process.
- Scott confirmed understanding of the Docker file automation.
- Scott inquired if the solution also removes the need for manual SDL customization.
- Scott Suggested a feature to auto-populate SDL with appropriate resource settings for AI models, reducing cognitive load on users.
##### Piyush Choudhary:
- Clarified that the solution does not depend on version tags in the SDL.
- Explained that the environment builds are managed by background scripts that handle framework detection and deployment commands.
- Explained the solution's goal to simplify deploying applications from GitHub to Akash:
- Eliminates the need to create Docker files manually.
- The solution manages the deployment process and updates.
- A GUI will allow users to log in with GitHub, select repositories, and deploy without creating an SDL manually.
- Users can see a preview of the SDL, but it is auto-generated based on the repository and environment variables.

#### Demo by Lukas Meilhammer
- Noted that there were 22 minutes left and handed the floor to Lukas and Maury.
- Mentioned that Lukas's team had been active on Discord, addressing technical challenges while deploying on Akash.
- Lukas introduced their project, a data and knowledge marketplace allowing users to monetize or control access to their data.
- Lukas highlighted key features such as private or public databases, token-based access, and infrastructure for reward distribution.
- Explained the integration with decentralized cloud services like Store J.
- Presented a demo of the platform, emphasizing the user interface for database management and access control.

**Integration with Akash**
##### Lukas Meilhammer:
- Tyler requested clarification on how Akash is being utilized in their deployment, focusing on practical implementation and related issues.
- Described their current deployment architecture, with different providers handling different components:
  - Frontend on one provider.
  - S3 storage gateway on another.
  - Backend and database on a third provider.
- Mentioned challenges with Docker images and potential solutions.
- Expressed interest in integrating solutions discussed earlier in the meeting to streamline their deployment process.
- Invited feedback from the community and highlighted the need for deployment best practices and clearer roadmaps to reduce friction and redundancy in resolving issues.
#### Maury De Jesus:
- Added details about the current deployment status on Akash:
  - Entire platform is running on Akash.
  - Database is stored on Store J.
  - Frontend, backend, and S3 gateway are integrated with the Akash network.
- Opened the floor for questions.

**Questions and Discussions on Lukas Demo**
- Anil Murty asked about specific issues faced during deployment and how they were addressed.

- Expressed willingness to schedule calls for further discussion and technical collaboration.
**Next Steps:**
- Lukas and Maury's team to explore integrating solutions presented by Piyush to enhance their deployment process.
