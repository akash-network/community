- **Presentation on Go Client Libraries by Joao Luna**:
  - Joao Luna has been working on the client library for some time.
  - The library is part of the core codebase at Akash and is accessible for deeper exploration.
  - The goal is to make the library open source, allowing broad accessibility.
  - Demonstrated the usage of the Go client library with Akash API, focusing on fee grants.
  - Highlighted the benefits of the library in abstracting complexities for developers.
  - Provided an example of a deployment using fee grants, shared a URL for demonstration.
  - Discussed the potential for integrating memory keychains and other improvements.

- **Discussion on Leveraging Go Client Work for Akash API by Scott**:
  - Scott Carruthers is interested in using the Go client work for further development around Akash API.
  - Joao Luna explained how the library simplifies interactions with Akash API and supports various integrations.
  - Discussion on managing deployment with different depositors and leveraging fee grants programmatically.
  - Scott and Joao discussed potential methods for sharing code and collaborating on documentation.

- **Demo by Joao Luna on Web3 Platform**:
  - Joao Luna presented a live demo of a Web3 platform he has been building for over a year.
  - The platform aims to provide a cloud experience using decentralized protocols, offering features similar to traditional cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud.
  - Users can create their own cloud with high availability setups, select data centers globally, and integrate storage with Akash compute.
  - The platform is currently live in a beta state and is open for beta testers to help scale and identify bugs.

- **Platform Features**:
  - Login options include standard login or GitHub integration.
  - Users can add credits to their accounts with straightforward billing; no surprise bills as users set a budget limit.
  - Marketplace (to be renamed Templating) allows users to create deployments with a user-friendly interface without needing to understand SDL.
  - Users can configure ports, container commands, arguments, environment variables, and GPUs.
  - Deployment status can be monitored in real-time, with access to logs, billing information, events, and revisions.

- **Deployment Example**:
  - Joao demonstrated creating a deployment using the platform.
  - Highlighted the ability to deploy services like Grafana on Akash network.
  - Deployment management includes choosing trusted providers and maintaining high availability by redeploying to other providers if one goes down.

- **Q&A and Discussion**:
  - **User's Balance**: Balance is held in USD, not tied to any cryptocurrency.
  - **Custodial Wallets**: The platform uses a mix of individual and special wallets to manage deployments.
  - **Fee Grants**: With the latest network upgrade, fee grants are utilized to streamline token and wallet management, enhancing operational efficiency.
  - **Currency Pools**: There's potential to support stable currencies like USDC for more stability and equilibrium-based systems in the future.
  - Joao Luna completed his demo, emphasizing the platform's ability to manage decentralized cloud services efficiently.
  - Joao highlighted the upcoming use of fee grants to improve operational efficiency.

- **Anil Murty's Summary of Near-term Plans for Console Improvements**:
  - Anil shared a summary on Twitter and detailed plans on GitHub.
  - **Feedback-driven Improvements**:
    - **Private Container Registries**: Essential for AI/ML developers who prefer keeping their container images private. This feature has already been shipped.
    - **Support for Standard Linux Images**: Mimicking AWS/GCP/Google experiences by allowing users to SSH into VMs with standard Linux images. This will be integrated into Akash to simplify user experience.
    - **Automatic Build and Deploy**: Targeting web developers from platforms like Vercel or Netlify who are not infrastructure-focused. This will streamline the process from code to deployment.
    - **Custodial and Non-Custodial Wallets**: Supporting both custodial and non-custodial experiences to attract non-crypto users, providing a seamless, non-wallet-based interface.
  - **Praetor Integration**:
    - **Unified Frontend**: Integrating Praetorâ€™s functionality within the Console to simplify provider management and improve user experience.
    - **Storage Solutions**: Exploring integrations with StoreJ, Filecoin, etc., and making these accessible through a user-friendly UI.

- **Open Discussion**:
  - **Questions and Feedback**:
    - Questions were raised about the implications and rollout of these new features.
    - Anil emphasized the importance of these improvements in removing current barriers to Akash adoption and enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Further Discussion by Anil Murty**:
  - **Periodic Data Backups**: Emphasized the importance of enabling users to easily back up their data periodically, particularly for users who host services that require persistent storage.
  - **VM Access Concerns**: Addressed a query from Dominikus Brian about SSH access to VMs. Anil clarified that due to Akash's reliance on Kubernetes, direct VM access isn't feasible. Instead, users can SSH into containers.
  - **Micro VMs**: Mentioned the potential future exploration of micro VMs, although it would require significant effort to implement.

- **Joao Luna's Feedback and Discussion**:
  - **User Experience with VMs**: Joao raised concerns about the user perception of running VMs on Akash. He noted that users might face limitations when running Kubernetes clusters within containers, which could lead to confusion.
  - **Messaging and Expectations**: Anil agreed that clear messaging is crucial. The primary objective is to provide users with a familiar experience by allowing easy SSH access from their terminals.

- **Open Discussion and Questions**:
  - **Dominikus Brian**: Asked about SSH access and its limitations.
  - **Joao Luna**: Suggested exploring alternative solutions for VM-like experiences, considering the constraints of running containers within virtualized environments.

- **Joao Luna's Final Question**:
  - **SSH vs. Shell Connection**:
    - Joao Luna: Asked why shell connection isn't an option currently.
    - Anil Murty: Explained that users prefer using their own terminals, and there's a bug in the current shell causing session breaks when the provider restarts. It's on the core team's roadmap to fix this issue.
    - Maxime Beauchamp: Added that users generally prefer SSH through their own terminal.

- **Unrelated Query from Jannick H**:
  - **Ledger Amino Sign for Akash JS**:
    - Jannick: Asked if signing transactions on the Akash console frontend with a ledger is planned.
    - Anil Murty: Stated it's not currently planned as it's the first request. Akash JS is open source, and contributions are welcome.
    - Tyler Wright: Encouraged discussion on this topic in the Akash JS Channel on Discord for further feedback.

- **Discussion on Awesome Akash Repo Cleanup**:
  - Tyler Wright: Mentioned ongoing cleanup work by PiberDev on the Awesome Akash repo, seeking feedback from the Sig clients.

- **Closing Remarks**:
  - Tyler Wright: Thanked participants, highlighted upcoming meetings (Sig support, Sig providers, and the working group for Akash website and documentation), and urged continued engagement on Discord.
