# **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG clients. This is a bimonthly meeting.

Tyler Wright: During this special interest group for clients on members of the community and teams that are building clients on a Akash come together to talk about any blockers, pain points, issues etc. This has typically been a monthly meeting but as of the last six months with a number of teams building various solutions on top of Akos and limited availability where this meeting really ultimately ended up with a number of people saying that they were going to join but ultimately that Kosh console team is one of the only teams that would consistently join. We change the cadence to every other month.

Tyler Wright: Again, this is a meeting for folks that are building easier ways to deploy onto the Akos network. this is for folks that are leveraging the AOSH API or AOSJS or any other integrations to again come together about core code, talk about any pain points etc. We oftent times get updates from the Akash console product team at Overclock Labs about a number of things that they've been working on over the last month or two. again this is the last TIG client's meeting of 2024. there is a number of things that are being worked on by the core engineering team.

Tyler Wright: you can find those items on GitHub in the projects area. There is a road map for again product and engineering where you can track some of the items that are on being worked in progress right now in testing and on the road map for the future. Again, I know that the members of the Overclock Labs core team are continuing to update the road map and add a number of items based upon priority and importance as we continue to end the year and move into 2025. I know there are a number of teams that have reached out to me publicly and privately that are building integrations and clients and ways to deploy onto the Kasha network.

Tyler Wright: I think some folks said that they won't be able to make it today. Some folks are going to be ready to go live in the next month or two. so, again, I'm trying to stress those teams to at least join these meetings to give a demo of, their applications in d. Without further ado, unless anybody has any agenda items, I want to hand it over to Max B who usually leads us through just updates on the console team. I also brought in Dennis who leads design on many of the project products as well as marketing, branding, etc. because I know there's just been a number of updates over the last couple of months on the console side.

Tyler Wright: At our last SIG providers meeting, the Ptor team gave an update on all things related to the Akos provider on the console. This is something that's a part of the console 2.0 effort that also gets discussed during SIG clients. But again, I just want to see if there's any I'll hand it over to Max B and potentially Dennis to talk about what's been going on on the Kosh console front. see if there's any questions on anything related to API, AOSJS, or if there's any other teams on the call that maybe want to talk about potential solutions. the max speed. Feel free to take it

Maxime Beauchamp: Thanks, There has been a lot of updates definitely in the past two months for console. I'm gonna share my screen so it's easier for everyone to So yeah, the main update in the past two months is definitely fiat payments or credit card payments. So yeah, now users can deploy on a cash using their credit card so they use their credit card to buy credit on console and use those credits to pay for deployments.

Maxime Beauchamp: So just a quick little demo and yeah at the same time this page for new deployments has been revamped and one of the new features that has been released last week this week and also yeah this is a new thing as well because we're getting spammed by a lot of new accounts for this and u so yeah you can create deployment without signing a transaction or using your own wallet which is a very innovative and game changer for a cash. We've had a record breaking usage through console in the past month because of that.


### 00:05:00

Maxime Beauchamp: and yeah right now I'm using my own account and I already added my credit card but normally there's a free trial that we implemented which makes it possible for users to use a cash without even creating an account. You can just click on start trial you get $10 of free credits so you can try a cash out without any commitment. and also one of the newest feature as well that was released this week it was done by a community member slash team called human hq.

Maxime Beauchamp: they've been doing a lot of great work on the website and console and we released that this week which is basically a versol deployment experience. So you can connect your repo or access deploy any repo by just putting up the URL or connect your GitHub bit bucket or GitLab whatever repo and it'll just fetch the repo and deploy it automatically and also update itself when you commit on the main branch or whatever branch you specify.

Maxime Beauchamp: So this is one of the core features that is part of the console 2.0 project which is available or you can see it on the GitHub project board where we keep track of all the tasks related to that. That was one of the big biggest feature that we wanted to release for console 2.0 know and so yeah you can try it out give us your feedback on it works pretty well not going to go into too indepth demo as of now but wanted to mention it we also added the Cosmos Metallask extension snap wallet so you can connect

Maxime Beauchamp: your MetaMask wallet which contains a AK support through MetaMask snaps which was done by one of the community members in the past year or so and it was finally released in the past two months. what else? I think this is mostly We done a ton of work behind the scenes for free trial support because it does attract a lot of abuse and people trying to game it. But now we stabilized it and it's a very good thing for a cashache.

Maxime Beauchamp: So yeah, that's basically it.

Tyler Wright: Thank you, Max, for going through a number of new features that you and the rest of the team have been working on for some time. I know again wider announcements are going to be going out in the future. but again, if anybody wants to test some of these features that hasn't already tested some of these features, again, feel free to reach out inside the SIG clients channel. But major shout out to all the work from again the product team across a kosh console. Again we'll save any conversation related to the provider side of console for sig providers but I know anal has talked about the console 2.0 plan in general during these SIG clients meetings and that plan is in full motion.

Tyler Wright: Again, you can look at the product and engineering roadmap to see where things are. But I know both on the deployment side and on the provider side, there've just been a number of updates over the last couple of months and a lot of improvements and continued improvements. Just as a reminder if anybody has any issues that they see related to the Kosh console again inside the console repo there is an area for issues and people can open up any issues. again Max and the rest of the team do a good job of responding to comments or responding to issues and again we talked about it async and s support as well.


### 00:10:00

Tyler Wright: Any questions on anything Akos console related and the update from Max and the rest of the team again I know there's some other teams either here or that are going to be listening to this call later that are building solutions on top of the Akos network leveraging the AOS API and AOSJS. I just wanted to see if there was any questions that anybody wanted to talk about live as it pertains to the Akash API, AOSJS or any other forms for integrating with the AOS network. Cool.

Tyler Wright: One thing that we've also talked about during the steering committee as well as SIG chain which we'll talk about next week in a little bit more detail is around the upgrade. Again, the Cosmos SDK 47 upgrade will affect clients. So there is a test net that is in phase one right now with members of the community as well as members of the core engineering team that are working on just again all the actions and functionality of the CLI postcosmos SDK 47. so again there's a test net active right now that's being worked on.

Tyler Wright: Once that phase one is complete, then folks that are building clients are leveraging the API integrations, there will be a sandbox test environment on those teams to see the updates to the Cosmos SDK47 and make any necessary changes. There will be documentation available too. So again, please look out for announcements across Discord, SIG clients, or just various other channels for next steps there. But just again that's coming out in the next couple of weeks leading up to the new year. So just keep your eyes peeled for announcements there if you're building an integration onto the Kosh network and leveraging again the API or JS.

Tyler Wright: I did want to see if there's anybody else that wanted to talk about anything related to clients. Cool. If not then again you all can have some time back. Again much appreciate everyone joining the last sick clients meeting of 2024. Again between meetings there will be some updates in terms of Cosmos SDK47. So if you are building an integration, just look out for announcements in Discord and other channels. again big round of applause all the work that the Clash Console team has been doing. so again please look out for continued updates on that clash console side. If anybody has any questions or comments feel free to drop them in SIG clients channel. And then again I hope everyone has a great rest of the month and year on the client side.

Tyler Wright: 

Tyler Wright: But there's a number of other ways to get involved with So feel free to join another SIGER working group. but again, thank you Max for the updates. Thank you everyone for your participation today and this year. And I'll see you all on the client side in 2025.

Maxime Beauchamp: Thanks, Tyler. And thanks

Tyler Wright: Appreciate you all.

Rodri R: to you both.

Tyler Wright: Thank you all.
