## Meeting Notes

### Introduction
- **Tyler Wright:**
  - Welcomed participants to the bi-monthly SIG Clients meeting.
  - Focus of the meeting was on updates and developments related to clients being built on the Akash Network.

### Updates on Clients
- **Tyler Wright:**
  - Provided an update on Cloudmos, now rebranded as Console, which continues to be the primary deployment tool on Akash.
  - Mentioned the upcoming Cosmos SDK 47 upgrade and its potential impact on both Terraform providers and Go client libraries.
    - **Terraform Providers and Go Libraries:** 
      - Work is already planned to address compatibility and functionality with the SDK upgrade.
      - Detailed discussions on these updates will be deferred to future meetings.

### Changes in Meeting Cadence
- **Tyler Wright:**
  - Announced a change in the meeting frequency from monthly to bi-monthly.
    - **Reason:** The availability of updates from other sources, including the steering committee and product/engineering roadmap, reduced the need for monthly meetings.
  - Emphasized the importance of the SIG Clients Discord channel as a primary communication and update platform.
    - Encouraged members to share ideas for improving the user experience or adding new features to Console via Discord.

### Console Team Updates

- **Tyler Wright:** 
  - Transitioned the discussion to the Console team for updates on recent work and future plans.

#### Updates from Maxime Beauchamp:
- **Managed Wallets on Console:**
  - Significant progress has been made toward enabling managed wallets on Console.
  - The feature is designed to abstract away the complexity of managing on-chain wallets, making the platform more accessible to users.
  - **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** 
    - Near completion, with plans to release it to production shortly.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - The team has been actively addressing bugs reported by users.
  - Focus has been on improving the overall user experience, especially as the platform sees increased usage.

#### Updates from Anil Murty:
- **Trial Wallet Implementation:**
  - Focused on the implementation of managed wallets and the integration of credit card payments on Console.
  - **Trial Wallet:** 
    - Allows users to experience Console without needing a wallet or login.
    - Currently in beta testing within Overclock Labs, with plans to extend testing to a broader audience soon.
    - Potential use in an upcoming hackathon in India as part of the extended testing phase.
- **Shared Packages:**
  - The codebase has been reorganized to separate shared packages.
  - **Impact:** 
    - This restructuring allows for parallel development of different components, such as the new user interface for the provider console.
- **Persistent Storage Tracking:**
  - Persistent storage is now being tracked in Console's statistics, in addition to ephemeral storage.
  - **Benefit:** 
    - Enables more accurate monitoring and reporting of storage usage across providers.
- **Exponential Backoff Algorithm Update:**
  - The algorithm has been updated to improve the user experience by ensuring new providers appear online more reliably and quickly.
- **CICD Progress:**
  - Significant progress has been made in enhancing the CICD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline.
  - **Features:**
    - Users will be able to connect their repositories (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab).
    - Automatic building and deployment of applications.
    - Triggering redeployments based on new pull requests.
