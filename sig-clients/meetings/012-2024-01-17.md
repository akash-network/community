- Greg Osuri expressed fascination with the platform and suggested the possibility of a more private session to delve deeper into its details.
- Luna acknowledged that while the discussion around funding and open-sourcing had been ongoing, it wasn't a top priority.
- However, they now plan to open-source the client libraries to give back to the community.
- Greg advised Luna on the importance of open-sourcing the libraries to receive valuable feedback before seeking funding.
- Greg emphasized the challenge of assessing the library's quality without the ability to use it and suggested building credibility through open sourcing.
- Luna inquired about a repo called "node API" in the Akash Network organization and asked if it might be a tentative client library.
- Greg was not familiar with the repo but suggested following up offline or potentially involving Artur for more insights.

### Discussion on AKT Requirement for Deployments
- Tyler welcomed Prashant from the Spheron team and highlighted the issue they encountered regarding the AKT required for each deployment.
- Prashant provided a high-level overview of the issue faced by Spheron as they scaled their activities on the network.
- Noted that with around 550 active providers, they faced challenges related to liquidity and locking up funds for creating leases.
- Shared that Spheron is working on launching providers with zero AKT as a solution to mitigate the problem.
- Plans to announce and test this approach, considering its potential effectiveness for addressing the liquidity and scalability issues.
#### Greg Osuri's Response and Offer of Support
- Greg acknowledged the challenges faced by Spheron and suggested a stopgap solution, offering to provide some AKT as a loan from the core team.
- Raised the idea of reconsidering the five AKT parameter, suggesting a potential reduction during a network upgrade.
- Prashant acknowledged the offer of support from the core team and reiterated the challenge faced by projects in terms of liquidity.
- Discussed the impact on projects as they drive adoption, emphasizing the need for a solution to avoid potential problems for projects.

#### Artur Troian's Clarification:
- Artur differentiated between two types of deposits: deployment deposit and big deposit, confirming the focus on the deployment deposit.
- Explained that the value of the deployment deposit is under review internally to determine the optimal parameter.
- Greg proposed initiating a governance proposal to change the deployment deposit parameter to one AKT, considering the current value of AKT.
- Prashant questioned the necessity of the deposit, prompting Artur to suggest moving the discussion to GitHub for further elaboration.
- Tyler directed Prashant to create a GitHub discussion specifying the deployment deposit issue for community involvement.
- Encouraged prompt action from Prashant to initiate the discussion on GitHub
- Prashant committed to initiating the GitHub discussion promptly and informed the community within the week.

### Additional Discussion on Deployment Deposit:
- Greg Osuri recalled that the deposit was initially required because the escrow needed some AKT to get started, preventing misuse.
- Artur clarified two reasons for the deposit:
  - Preventing providers from creating deployments without a deposit, exhausting resources quickly.
  - Ensuring providers remain active; without a deposit, providers might become inactive.
- Max suggested using USDT for the deposit, and Artur acknowledged the potential, but mentioned concerns about the availability of providers accepting USDT
- Prashant explained that Spheron had its own providers to address bidding cost concerns and liquidity challenges associated with using USDT.
- Prashant proposed reducing the deposit to zero, arguing that maintaining liquidity and capital for USDT could be burdensome for clients.
- Artur clarified that setting the deposit to zero would break the deployment and bid processes,
- Emphasizing the necessity of a deposit for the SQL account to work.
- Artur suggested lowering the deposit rather than setting it to zero, acknowledging the need for a deposit but discussing the value.
### Artur's Presentation on Akash API 
- Artur is working on the Akash API and shared insights on solving issues related to changing API versions.
- The challenge discussed was the lack of visibility on the client side regarding the supported Akash API version on the RPC node.
- Artur proposed extending the RPC endpoint to serve version information. This feature will be available in the upcoming partial version.
- There will be proper examples and guidelines for implementing this feature in different languages.
- The clients' discovery checks the supported Akash API version and generates clients accordingly.
- Documentation for providers, including information on types and API requests, is being generated for better human readability.
- Feature Discovery will be available for both provider and node sides.
- Tyler encouraged Artur to initiate GitHub discussions and share information with the community.

### Additional Points from Artur on Akash API
- The primary goal of the Akash API is to simplify documentation and enhance external user access to products.
- Aim to separate it completely from the Converse, considering them as distinct entities with different purposes.
- Using protobuf for types description from providers like jpcloud to streamline generation.
- Instead of generating protobuf every time, supply already generated protobuf things, ensuring compatibility.
- Focus on making it easy for developers to start interacting with the blockchain.
- The Akash API is still in progress, with upcoming additions to the [repository]( https://github.com/akash-network/akash-api).
- Plans to release it as a mainstream version in the next few months for broader implementation and understanding.
### Discussion on Moderation API and CRDs
- Deval Patel raises a question about whether the Moderation API, which is being developed to expose the CRD (Custom Resource Definition) for white listing and block listing, should be exposed through the Akash API or the Provider Service API.
- Artur suggests keeping it in the provider repository for now.
- Artur clarifies that the CRD itself is not an API but rather a behavioral description of how certain things operate within Kubernetes.
- It is decided to keep the CRD inside the provider repository for the time being.
- Artur informs Deval that the PR review for this matter will be held until some releases related to feature discovery and deploy operator are completed, as these changes affect the deployment process.
- Deval explains that the reason for exposing the API through Provider Services is to provide a UI where users can view the list of filters and update them.
### Closing remarks
- Tyler highlights Luna's upcoming discussion on the Provider schema for next week's meeting.
- Tyler encourages participants to engage in GitHub discussions related to Provider schema and upgrades.
- Prashant's question on provider upgrades to be addressed as a topic in the next meeting.
- Alani Kuye expresses interest in Luna's discussion on the provider schema for its relevance to provider reviews.
### Action Items
