## Meeting Notes

### Console Updates from Maxime Beauchamp
- [Console milestones](https://github.com/akash-network/console/milestones) are being actively tracked via GitHub.
- Major focus on improving onboarding for managed wallet users:
  - Users must now create an account and input a credit card before accessing larger free trials to reduce bot abuse.
  - New Stripe-powered payment method released for reusability and ease of credit purchase.
- Managed Wallet API (v1) released:
  - Enables programmatic deployment actions via API.
  - Already being used by 11 Labs and other teams.
  - Final completion is pending JWT-based authentication rollout.
- Deployment alert system near completion:
  - Sends email alerts when escrow balance drops below a set threshold.
- Chain SDK (AkashJS successor) 90% complete:
  - TypeScript version mostly done.
  - Pending full migration to Cosmos SDK 47 for release.
- Upcoming features:
  - Cloud usage tracking dashboard (to help teams monitor cost and resource consumption).
  - Bid pre-check feature to avoid creating deployments that would receive no bids.
- Internal improvements:
  - Extensive repo cleanup and new validation checks to increase codebase reliability.

### Chain SDK and Python Support
- Alejandro and Rodri R asked about Python SDK plans.
- Max clarified that the current focus is TypeScript and Go, but future support for Python is possible under the chain SDK umbrella.
- Shrike asked how to contribute to the SDK.
- Max and Tyler explained that contributors should join the testnet and track announcements via Discord. Testnet expected in a few weeks.

### Community Demo: Akash Notebooks by Shrike and Alejandro
- Shrike introduced Akash Notebooks:
  - A simplified interface for data scientists and researchers using Jupyter.
  - Inspired by Kaggle and Google Colab, but with fewer limitations and Akash-backed GPU resources.
- Key goals:
  - Remove complexity (no need to understand Docker, ports, or Akash SDL).
  - Enable cloud deployment of Jupyter notebooks with flexible resource selection.
  - Provide access to GPUs without time limits and with folder structure support.
- Current capabilities:
  - GUI for setting CPU, memory, disk space.
  - Deployment interface with cost-per-day estimation.
  - Launch of Jupyter or Jupyter Lab directly from the app.
- Future plans:
  - Add GitHub project importing.
  - Fork Jupyter interface with custom Akash themes.
  - Integrate Nvidia Rapids, model parallelization, and user-specific controls.
  - Explore fiat payments and support for MetaMask and PayPal.
  - Open source the tool with community contribution pathways.

### Feedback and Discussion
- Max and Tyler encouraged documentation and integration of managed wallet API.
- Rodri and Tyler emphasized promotion, testing, and collecting community feedback before moving to funding request.
- Shrike confirmed the team will open-source the project and prepare demo videos and documentation.
- Plan to submit a proposal for funding from the community pool to work on the tool full-time.
- Max raised the possibility of deeper integration into Console, but acknowledged the value of purpose-built tooling.

#### Closing
- Tyler encouraged Shrike to continue sharing progress in SIG Clients and Discord.
- Look out for next SIG Clients meeting in two months.
- Upcoming SIG Providers meeting (July 2) will include updates on provider-side improvements.
- Meeting ended with thanks to all participants, especially Shrike for the live demo.

## Action Items
- Console Team:
  - Finalize deployment alerts and prepare for JWT integration.
  - Complete cloud usage dashboard and bid pre-check features.
- Shrike and Alejandro:
  - Prepare a GitHub repo with clear docs and demo videos.
  - Consider Submitting a community proposal for funding via GitHub Discussions.
  - Attend SIG Insiders or SIG Steering meetings for broader visibility.
- Community:
  - Watch for SDK 47 testnet announcements to contribute or test chain SDK.
  - Provide feedback on managed wallet API, bid pre-check, and deployment alerts.

## **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to STIG clients by monthly meeting. during the special interest group for clients, the Akos network community gets together to talk about everything related to clients on Akos.  This includes console previously cloudmos and a number of other cons or clients that may be leveraged ajs the AP other means to develop integrations for folks to deploy on the aos network.

Tyler Wright: We also have the sick providers group we'll be meeting tomorrow Wednesday usually meets on the last Wednesday of every month to go over things related to the provider in the AOS network community. But this is again a specialist group that used to meet monthly but now meets every other month to discuss all things related to clients on the Akash network.  appreciate everybody joining today. usually we get some updates from members of the Kosh console team. I see Max here today. but I just want to see if there's anything clientreated that anybody wants to discuss so we can add it to the agenda.

Shrike: I would like to present a app I'm working for data scientists and scientists working with Python and help them deploy things on Akos.

Shrike: So I would like to present the idea and kind of get some feedback on that. Thanks.

Tyler Wright: Absolutely. Okay,â€¦

Tyler Wright: I'll add that to the agenda item. So, we'll look to handed Mike back over to you after we get an update on console.  Again, if anybody has anything else that they want to discuss as it pertains to any client console or otherwise, please feel free to drop in a note u during the meeting or drop an idea for future meetings.  As we always do, I will hand the mic over to Max who is worked on again Kosh Console for a long time. previously built Cloudmos for updates on all things a Kos console.

Maxime Beauchamp: Thanks so in the past two months a lot of things have been worked for mainly around I'm going to share the link to the milestones that we keep track of everything for console related projects or issues or milestones in general. so yeah we're currently working on improving the user on boarding mainly so right now for managed wallets we released that in late 2024 and we've had a significant amount of usage increase over that period since the launch of that and following the feedback from the users

Maxime Beauchamp: and feedback from internal testing. We decided to change a little bit how the onboarding will be done for new users on the console that manage wallets. so there's a milestone tracking that and we are doing that in smaller chunks to eventually improve the user on boarding to be first you have to create a user account and then also input your credit card before receiving a bigger free trial. because we've had to deal with a lot of bots in the past.

Maxime Beauchamp: and the spam in general and overall it's going to make the user on board very well much better in general more streamlined and so work for that has been ongoing and we recently released a new stripe payment the new payment form where you can just add the payment method in there and reuse it in the future.  here without having to input it every time you want to purchase credits or cloud credits with the manage wallets. So this is ongoing.

Maxime Beauchamp: we did release the first version of the manage wallet API which enables we've had this request from a bunch of customers that wanted to interact with the deployments directly through an API and also one of the very interesting use case that I was thinking about while implementing that is for a AI agent  And one of the companies that we work with, Leven Labs, are implementing AI agents that are using this API currently, the manage world API.


### 00:05:00

Maxime Beauchamp: so we did release that but it's still an ongoing work because there's going to be a change in the way that users can authenticate to the providers released by the core team. It's called the JWT authentication. currently it works with the MTLS certificates but these are not the most userfriendly I would say and so we're waiting for JWT to be implemented from the core side to finalize the first version of the manage wallet API and this implementation from our side is mostly done.

Maxime Beauchamp: We're just waiting for testing and a bunch of smaller details. so we did that and then also recently we're still in the test phase slash almost done to release the deployment alerts. so just we call it deployment also but it's going to be used for more than just a deployments but as the first version of the new feature is to be notified when your deployment escrow balance goes below a certain threshold notified by email.

Maxime Beauchamp: And that's very useful because sometimes some if you don't keep track of the escrow balance on your deployments, they obviously just close if they're out of very important feature that we are currently releasing and we've been working on for the past couple months. what else? we did a lot of work also on the new chain SDK library which is the successor of AkashJS.

Maxime Beauchamp: we are still blocked on the migration to SDK47 for that but 90% of the work is done in terms of the chain SDK JavaScript library which will greatly simplify interacting with the Akash network using TypeScript. we done a ton of refactoring and just improvements from repository standpoint the console repo.

Maxime Beauchamp: we now have a bunch of checks when creating to make sure that everything is secure and a lot of checks that you can look at on the console repo if you feel like taking a deeper look at that. what else? we're also going to release soon a new page where you can track your cloud usage or deployment usage on console.

Maxime Beauchamp: So it's a feature that I think it's going to be quite important to scale further with the bigger customers because in general when you use a service it's nice to know how much you've been using and how much budget is allowed for that service. So in the coming weeks we should be able to release that.  So keep track of how much you're spending on deployments and how much you've added in manage wallets credit card cloud credits and then we're also working on improving the deployment experience on console by adding a feature that we call bid pre-check.


### 00:10:00

Maxime Beauchamp: So, one of the issues that we been having for a long time is that when you try to deploy something on the Aash network, the way that it works with the reverse auction mechanism is that you need to create a deployment first to be able to see if there's providers that are available to bid on that specific workload.  And that can be very frustrating and timeconuming to try and trial and error every time just for changing something in the SDL to make sure or to know if there's a provider that would bid on it.

Maxime Beauchamp: so yeah, we're working on implementing the bid pre-check feature where you'll be able to know before creating a deployment if there's a provider that would actually bid on it. So it'll make the deployment experience much smoother in general. what else?  Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like it's mostly what we've been working on in the past month or two. A lot of stuff going on. And then there was a cash accelerate which took a bit of time. We did some work there for I guess if Yanik is here or Julius maybe they can talk about ash ML.

Maxime Beauchamp: I don't know if that counts as a client or not, but been working on that as a team. And then other initiatives for star cluster,â€¦

Maxime Beauchamp: which is a new project that was announced in Akash Accelerate. That's it for me.

Tyler Wright: Perfect. Thank you very much,â€¦

Tyler Wright: Again Max is linked to the milestones inside the console repo in the Akos network GitHub organization where you can track timelines specific issues inside of these milestones and kind of track where work is. if anybody has any questions again there's a channel on Discord.

Tyler Wright: there's obviously GitHub and there's these meetings to be able to again talk to members of the Kosh console team, ask questions, give feedback. Obviously there's a console repo where you can drop in issues that have been escalated from discord from users in there that might be able to give support into something that again should be tracked as an issue and res So much appreciate the update from Max. Does anyone have any questions about  a kosh console related. I know Max also talked about the chain SDK which is I think significant work to make life easier for those that are trying to build clients or make it easier for folks that are trying to again build solutions that make it easier for others to deploy on a Kosh network. But just want to see if there's any questions about anything Max mentioned around Kos console chain SDK etc.

Tyler Wright: Go ahead, Alleundra.

Alejandro: Yeah, I think I read something about a Python equivalent to the AkashJS and I think they mentioned the chain SDK. is it that one we're waiting for?

Maxime Beauchamp: Where did you hear about a Python SDK? because we're not currently working on that.

Alejandro: I no I saw something a discussion on GitHub and somebody commented that we're waiting for the chain SDK and I didn't really know what it was. I believe it was the chain SDK.

Rodri R: I've also read something about this Python option. but not sure. I can't remember where.

Maxime Beauchamp: Hi. potentially yeah thanks for linking the issue but ultimately there are blocked by the SDK 47 upgrade which is underway. Arthur would probably know best how long it would take for the upgrade to fully be done. But, yeah, the goal for that chain SDK library or chain SDK repo is to contain all the libraries for each of the programming languages in a single place.


### 00:15:00

Maxime Beauchamp: But we will definitely start just by having the TypeScript andâ€¦

Tyler Wright: Go ahead.

Maxime Beauchamp: Go libraries and then eventually potentially Python or others. thanks for offering the chain SDK work for TypeScript has been mostly done.

Alejandro: I do.

Shrike: How can you is there a way for us to contribute to the chain SDK library to speed up the process a bit?

Maxime Beauchamp: Like I said, it's really about upgrading the chain to the Cosmos SDK 47,â€¦

Maxime Beauchamp: which is something that I'm not fully aware about all the details unfortunately.

Tyler Wright: I think that's a great call out.

Tyler Wright: I know that PC freak is a member of the community who I think wrote that discussion is around Python and Kosh API. it would be great for those that want to get more involved with the chain SDK just to make their voice heard inside the SIG clients channel. there is a test net that I believe should be starting in the next few weeks and I can get some of those members that want to get more involved to test out some things have access to an early environment and then be able to do any subsequent support work. so yes there are opportunities to support.

Tyler Wright: I think the core engineering team is currently the blocker but should be unblocking folks in the next couple of weeks with the test net environment after some things are rebased on the node and provider side.  But again, just drop a message if you can inside Discord or just look out for announcements around test net and then just make your voice heard when you can.  And the goal is to get as many technical folks from the AOSH community into that test net as possible to mess around with something that potentially they're working on that's client related or provide support for pain SDK and some of the other things that are happening around again the Pask migration and the next network upgrades.

Tyler Wright: Any other questions, comments around I don't want to dox this person. but there is a member of the core team that has been brought on to really be a senior product designer really work on console and a number of other items that make it easy for people to again deploy via console and beyond.

Tyler Wright: So again, if anybody has any questions or comments around I know again the console team is working on onboarding and updating you user experience flows, but feel free to drop any messages inside the K console channel. I know that person is actively looking at that channel and is open to feedback. this is also SIG client adjacent but there is some work being done around kind of and this is through SIG design but will also affect SIG clients around basically updating design language across everything that touches a clash so I know there's a number of folks out there that are building their own clients and their own tools that leverage the clash network for uniformity

Tyler Wright: and just like ease of use for those that maybe need design assets like buttons etc to kind of make life easier when you're building tools. again feel free to join SID design.  Feel free to look out for updates and sick clients happening over the next couple months for again getting involved in some of those general design user experience discussions. so that again is Akash networki continues to scale and more and more people are using it whether it be through guey tools or whether it be through chain SDK APIs etc.

Tyler Wright: there's a consistency of brand and consistent user experience for those users. Anything else that anybody wants to talk about before I hand it over to Shrek to give a demo on some work that they've been working All right, Shrek, feel free to talk a little bit about what you've been working on and see if there's any additional resources that you want to share. feel free.


### 00:20:00

Shrike: All so I mean I guess before I introduce what I've been doing, I should first tell you about what it is and why I've been doing so a bit of background on me. I first came to the Akash ecosystem. or one really big thing I'm very much into AI. I like to train AI models in all kinds of areas and I needed the kind of GPU kind of power. I need to get it from somewhere.  So I heard about Akash and I thought it was a really cool thing and that's why I came here and I've been training AI models on Akash for a while now but I was always very reserved about recommending Akash to my colleagues and my friends for one simple reason. It's just not very friendly to data scientists and scientists and anybody that wants to do this kind of simple work through Python.

Shrike: because I'm going to be honest, most data scientists and scientists don't know networking. They don't know what Docker is. They don't know I mean if you tell them to go on to Akash console, they'll just get confused. They won't understand a thing and you have to spend a good I don't know half an hour explaining what an SDL is and the entire system basically.  So me and a couple of friends, Alejandro in fact one of the people on this call we decided to get together and create an app it would mirror other apps that are used by data scientists. We were inspired by Google Collab and Kaggle. if I can present my screen here I think

Shrike: I believe you can see my screen right now.

Tyler Wright: Yes.

Shrike: So, I can just show you here Google Collab. How many of you are actually familiar with Jupyter Notebooks? okay, I realize you can't really tell me right now, but Jupyter Notebooks is basically a way to create run Python code in a very simple way. this is honestly I would say the main tool used by data scientists the main tool used by people that are instructed with data analysis and data visualization. This is kind of how it looks. You kind of run your code in here. This is on Google Collab. So a lot of the time you want to run these Jupyter notebooks on the cloud. So here I'm running it on Google servers. and here's Kaggle.

Shrike: This is another very often used by data scientists and it's very similar to Google Collab where you run these Jupyter notebooks on their servers but it has some major flaws.

Joshua Meyer: Yes.

Shrike: The biggest flaw for me at least is that the sessions are limited. So after an hour they close down. You can't train your AI model for more than an hour. you also can't have several files in one project. They don't have a folder system or anything. So there's a ton of more things like you add on to this that just make them very very inconvenient for running your Jupyter code on the cloud. And that's kind of where our app comes in. we're calling it Akash Notebooks.

Shrike: because we're not very creative about it. But it's kind of like a simple front end that we've laid out. here's a bunch of things we have planned. We're going to be able to have projects and data sets and all that. We're really mirroring kind of Kaggle. I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with Kaggle, but I'm just throwing that out there. and you can go in here you can create a new project choose your CPU memory in this space or whatever and you can deploy this looks very similar to a Kash console right now but I'm going to tell you about some key differences firstly you're not going to be doing anything with ports or anything the whole point is to really cut away on a lot of the things

Shrike: that you have to deal with on a kash console. You don't have to for example create a docker image. You don't have to understand docker at all. we are also planning to add as you can see here an interface to put your projects up on GitHub, load them in and kind of have several deployments running at once, several AIs you're training or several decision trees you're optimizing.  And here you can press the link and open up the Jupyter notebook. and like I said, here's the big difference between doing things here and doing things in Google Collab is that you have the entire folder structure available to you. and not only that, but you can much more cheaply than Google Collab access GPUs using, a cash network obviously.


### 00:25:00

Shrike: you can also choose your resources much more what's the word I'm looking for? Freely I guess compared to the other solutions. but yeah, I really just wanted to show this off to really get some feedback on what you guys think some extra features would be nice to have and what I could improve upon here. as well as any for criticisms if you think does anybody have anything they would like to say or any opinion they would like to share?

Shrike: Yes.

Maxime Beauchamp: That's very cool. can you show us a full demo of going through creating the deployment and just the entire flow?

Shrike: Yeah. Yeah.

Maxime Beauchamp: That would be nice. Thanks.

Shrike: So I just go create new project. I can choose how much memory I want and the disk space. I can also enable the GPU. I haven't completely hashed out this part of the deployment so I'm going to leave it off for now because it causes some bugs sometimes and then I just press deploy. It's going to wait for providers. I want to add some more what do you call User feedback here. So it's a little easier to kind of see how everything's going.

Shrike: And I'm thinking of adding bit of a progress bar. maybe overhauling the entire UI. But yeah, then it brings up this grid. You can view extra attributes. This is the URI and the address as well as the cost per day instead of month.  The reason I'm doing that is because most of the time you're not going to be training your AI for a month and you're not going to be using this for more than probably a couple of hours or a couple of days. So I thought this would be a little more relevant. You can also view extra attributes. these depend on what the specific provider is offering.

Shrike: But yeah, then you just press choose provider, you create the lease, and after a while, everything on this screen will disappear and I'll have another deployment running. but like I said, we haven't worked much on the user feedback. It just disappears. Doesn't say anything. But if you go back to the dashboard here, you'll see we have another one running. And I believe it's this one. This is  the deployment sequence and the block height of the particular thing. but a lot of this is probably going to be what do you Overhauled at some point. here you see it's warning me about this being like an HTTP endpoint and not HTTPS. I believe I can fix that. By default Jupiter works under HTTP.

Shrike: but I believe this is subject to change. we are also planning on sort of what's the word? overhauling or forking the Jupyter notebook thing here instead have our own Akash related, with their theme. And we're probably going to have a couple of buttons to control this specific deployment. but yeah, that was kind of the whole process. also I forgot to mention this, but you can open Jupyter Lab instead of Jupyter Notebook. I don't know how many of the difference, but that it's a possibility. any more questions?

Shrike: yeah.


### 00:30:00

Tyler Wright: Perfect. I really do appreciate you putting this together andâ€¦

Tyler Wright: sharing it here. again, I would love if there's a demo link that you could share with folks to get more feedback or maybe it's a demo video that you can get to share more feedback for those that might not be able to join. I'm also going to shout out this meeting during the steering committee just so people can look at this video and reference this. my first question is I guess from a business standpoint, is this something that you and Alejandro are I understand the main audience is kind of data scientists and AI folks that train AI models. Is the idea that this will be like a closed source product?

Tyler Wright: Do you intend for it to be kind of an open-source product? what are your plans beyond just where it is right now?  because it seems like it's coming along very nicely.

Shrike: Yeah,â€¦

Shrike: I forgot to mention that. So Alejandra and I, we're very like what's the source warriors. I don't know what to say. we dislike a monopolistic kind of closed source software. So we are planning on making all of this Really the code is open source right now. but we're planning on really having an entire what's the word? We're trying to build the repository so that it's very open source friendly so people can come in and help us develop the product. yeah. So this is going to be open source once we really create that proper GitHub page.

Shrike: which we're probably also going to put on demo videos and how you can use the app and how you can contribute and all that. so we're planning on making it open source  Yeah. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Again, I would love for you to have an open invite to this bimonthly meeting to give constant updates, especially as a product continues to mature. so you can always stay up to date, very much like the console team on connecting with the community on updates, how people can get involved, etc. Any other questions for Shrek or Alejandro? again, I'm sure that there will be more people that aren't here today that will have some additional questions. I would love for you when you're comfortable to share this more widely in Discord.

Tyler Wright: again, I'll connect the video, but I would love once the video is made live to the community for me or George, who I think is on the call, to also be able to link folks on GitHub to again a demo page or a landing page of some sort for these efforts because I know you guys are putting a lot of work in. Cool.

Shrike: I was also going to say we were planning on bringing up to the Akash steering committee and asking for a proposal to work on this full-time.

Shrike: If you have any tips regarding how to go through the process I would really appreciate. yes exactly.

Tyler Wright: So, your goal is to basically get pay for the community pool to continue work on this effort.

Tyler Wright: Okay. Yeah.

Shrike: We were also thinking of having some premiums on it.

Tyler Wright: I would just Yeah,â€¦

Shrike: So you get a free trial of this product for some we were thinking of different marketing plans for it. put you out.

Tyler Wright: I'm happy to follow up with you offline, but I would look at the GitHub discussions as a source of truth, but Human HQ, I know that the Overclock Labs team, there's been a number of teams that have written kind of proposals outlining the problem statement, the solution, a budget,  how the money will be used, etc. So, I think there's a number of good templates out there. I'll also drop in a link to that Adam wrote around governance proposals. I'm happy to look at a draft or have other people in the community here kind of look at a draft and get you feedback, but again, there's been a number of examples.  I think you've already started on the right track by doing some work putting in again some effort and taking from an idea to something that's real and already sharing a demo via the SIG client's structure.

Tyler Wright: So again, many steps in the right direction, but please take a look at the discussions and take a look at some discussions that are kind of similar to yours in terms of kind of like development ads from the community pool and then look at the best practices. Go ahead, Max.  I see her hand up.


### 00:35:00

Maxime Beauchamp: So I noticed most of the UIs are very similar to What other features do that you think your app will have that is different from console? And also considering that have you considered potentially integrating that feature of deploying Jupiter notebooks because technically you can with console.  There's S templates that you can deploy like Jupiter notebooks or other AI workflows on a cache directly with console. Have you considered maybe integrating that directly in there instead of building a separate app?

Shrike: So, this is kind by the way we obviously took a lot of inspiration from Akash console when we were developing this application. but yeah, this is kind of like the thing that this app is made for. It's to abstract away a lot of the things that So obviously Akash console is  It's a very generalpurpose tool. It's made for literally anybody can use it. as well as data scientists. but the problem I find is that most of them don't like the added bloat and complexity that it brings. when I started I was obviously just using the template all the time because it's very convenient and I have to say you guys have done a really good job creating a cache console.

Shrike: It's a very convenient application for me, but most people that do this kind of work don't understand these things. And so that's kind of where our app comes in.  And the point is kind of you can very intuitively understand how the app works because it's made what's the word like parallel to something like Kaggle or Google Collab.  made to be the same as the services that the data scientists are already familiar with. And we're all also planning on adding extra support for things like Nvidia's rapids framework or model parallelization.

Shrike: So this is kind of just the first basic step, but then we're also going to add a bunch of extra features really tailored towards this smaller group of Akash users. that's kind of what sets it apart from console.

Maxime Beauchamp: Okay, Thanks for specifying that. because we have had other teams integrating specific UIs for different kinds of workloads for example the build and deploy application or if you click on deploy on console and you see on the left there's three big sections where it's deploy build and deploy a Linux in instance or custom instance and

Maxime Beauchamp: The build and deploy essentially abstracts away also the intricacies of building your own docker image and also abstracts away a lot of the SDL details in there and I know that it doesn't make sense to start integrating some specific features to the Jupiter AI  notebook deployments in the console UI general UI, but maybe it could be part of a separate option in the deployment low to create this deployment. But yeah, I get the idea to have a very very focused application for this type of user for sure.

Maxime Beauchamp: But also I wanted to mention that one of the things that we worked a lot in the past that I mentioned also earlier is to abstract away the use of AKT directly because it's also one of the things that there's a lot of friction to get started. I see the sad face. especially for AI scientists or data analysis or any technical users that are not familiar with crypto. That's why we implemented the manage wallet with credit card.  It makes it easier for noncryptonative users to get started with a cache.


### 00:40:00

Maxime Beauchamp: And that's why we also did the manage wallet API which you could potentially use with an API key to charge users with USD instead of AKT or having the users to install Kepler then create a wallet and then buy the tokens and all that stuff. So maybe something you could explore.  Yeah.

Shrike: Yeah, fiat was part of our road map, but Tyler wants to say something.

Tyler Wright: No. Yeah, I was going to ask that question. From the demo, it looked like that you had to connect the Kapper wallet to be able to use the tool. Is that correct right now?

Shrike: Yeah, right now it's just built for Kepler, but we're obviously planning to really support most of the wallets that people use Meta or Binance or whatever. but also we were planning on doing something with fiat so you're able to use PayPal to pay for the services. we haven't looked at this managed wallets API. but thanks for mentioning that. what's your discord tag name? So in case I want to ask you more about this, I can DM you on Discord. Max, I'm talking to you.

Maxime Beauchamp: Yeah, It's Backtune 14.

Shrike: Black Tune 14.

Maxime Beauchamp: Backtune. I'm part of the admins. Max B is my name in this screen.

Shrike: Yeah, thanks.

Maxime Beauchamp: You should see me andâ€¦

Shrike: Yeah, thanks.

Maxime Beauchamp: I'll manage wallet API documentation that is very PC modeâ€¦

Maxime Beauchamp: because we are still waiting for JWT to final finalize it. But yeah, the documentation should be more detailed and just better presented in the next couple weeks. this is what we have as currency.

Tyler Wright: Thank you,â€¦

Tyler Wright: If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out in Discord, but I would, certainly urge you and the rest of your team to just again put together, a proposal to support all already the work that you've already done. Maybe high highlighting some of the questions that you've already been brought up here in terms of why this tool specifically is a better solution than maybe integrating into AOS console.

Tyler Wright: Again, budget, maybe some of the future items that you have on the road map. just so again, folks in the community could be aware. but I really do appreciate, I'm sure others, echo, you putting this forward and bring this forward to the community.

Shrike: Make sure to do that.

Tyler Wright: Any other client related conversation that anybody wants to have? if not, then obviously thank you, Max, for all the updates as it pertains to Kosh console, chain SDK, and some of the other efforts, as we lead up to the Kasos SDK 47 migration, the next network upgrade.  Again, we'll talk more about the network upgrade on the blockchain side during SIG chain which will be happening I believe next week. much appreciate Shrek for leading the demo on some work that he's been doing around again simplifying and building a guey tool for specifically data scientists and folks in his world that maybe again console is a little bit too much for them right now just like a focused smaller product. Thank you for the demo.

Tyler Wright: I think next steps for that team are to put forth a discussion if they're looking for funds from the community pool to continue work and development. But again, either way please share this with the wider community for feedback. If there's nothing else then we can end it a little bit earlier. Again, we'll see you all in two months. SIG providers will be happening to tomorrow.  will be to talk about all things on the provider on the Akash network including the provider side of the Akash console. and then steering committee will be happening on Thursday. so again forward to seeing Looking forward to seeing that discussion hopefully from Shrek Alejandro and the rest of the team.

Tyler Wright: and really looking forward to all the updates that have been happening and will continue to happen across console and some of the other efforts.  Again, I'll make sure everyone here is made aware of the upcoming test net so those that are building clients or want to get involved in, testing chain to testing some of the other items as we get ready for the network upgrade can get in there early and start to mess around. Hope everyone has a great rest of your day. Thank you all for joining today and we shall see you soon.  Goodbye.

Alejandro: Bye.
