## Notes
- last month, had a demo from Fleek.xyz about something they're working on, possible future integrations
- Praetor team had an update on Helm-based installs for providers + being able to support GPU testnet

Anil:
- details to be published on incentivized testnet for GPU. two phases: 
	- first phase to incentivize two groups of people: providers to set up with GPUs, people to build SDLs for deploying AI models onto those GPUs
	- second phase to incentivize benchmarking, measuring the time it takes to run inference on AI models
- in the absence of Praetor, use Helm charts CLI-based approach
- hoping to start incentivized testnet on May 29
	- Jigar confirmed testnet to be ready next week

Deval:
- hoping to get everything done by next sig-providers meeting: Helm chart update, testnet support for GPU
- working on backend as well but not current priority

### Open Registry demo
- a container registry acts as a repository/management tool of container images - OpenRegistry aims to provide a decentralized 
- added support for decentralized storage backends: Storj, IPFS, Filebase, any S3 compatible storage backend
- integrated with Storj using two different interaction mechanisms:
	- satellite system using uplink tooling
	- S3 gateway
- working on automated builds, ephemeral deployments for container images
	- already have support for Github actions - can connect Github repository with OpenRegistry to automate builds
- rewrote frontend application - sign in with GitHub, WebAuth integration, Passkeys (passwordless authentication, can share credentials across devices, only requires identifier)
	- looking to extend support for GitLab, possibly Keplr
- can likely have a demo of end product by next sig-clients meeting
- will be supporting both public and private container images
- [.yml files available](https://github.com/containerish/OpenRegistry), can be run on Akash

### Go Client Libraries demo
- cloud-native tools (Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker) and blockchains (Akash) use Go, but there is no official client library to be used with Akash - APIs not exposed, third parties cannot easily use
- similar to [AkashJS](https://github.com/ovrclk/akashjs) (Javascript library), Luna presenting a Go library that makes it easy to deploy on Akash, create services that extend functionality
- create a request to the networking with a corresponding DSEQ
- only dependencies are the client and upstream types - no need for anything with gRPC, Cosmos, addresses, bech32
- can query specific deployments, providers
- currently only available on testnet
- offers helper functions to build the request
- can specify transaction options (default 5 AKT deposit or arbitrary value), abstractions on currency types (ex, AKT or uAKT)

### Action Items
- Luna to share Go Client Library source code for review, Tyler to set up dedicated session for next steps and post in Discord's #wg-client-libraries
	- [Github Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/222) open for Quasarch Funding Proposal
- Open Registry on agenda for next sig-clients meeting
- Source Network demo in future meeting
- PR to be opened for container-registry-clients folder in [sig-clients](https://github.com/akash-network/community/tree/main/sig-clients) directory
