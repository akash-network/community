## Notes
- Cloudmos supported GPU testnet, just ended 7/19

### Spheron Update
- Prashant:
	- major update: Spheron UI revamp
	- incorporated data form - anyone can launch their applications using Terraform module
	- can attach ephemeral and persistent storage in Spheron
	- showcased proxy
	- integrated Stride for fiat payments with associated legal structuring
	- drafting hackathons

- Akash Network Devs Discord:  "#ecosystem-" prefix in "[Deployments]" section for client-related discussion, feedback

- Anil: Is Spheron team separating storage/compute portions of UI?
	- Prashant: Yes - working on revamping UI with clear separation between Spheron services (compute, storage, Terraform). In the future, will interconnect everything for cross-service use

### Akash Console Update
Joseph:
- all updates related to GPU support, general UI updates
- some changes in akashjs: manifest generation, changes to SDL format - update if not using current version

Anil:
- Github issues [104](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/104)/[106](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/106)
- when testing GPU support, found issues in core codebase where clients order services, resources requested for services
	- ex: if two services and two resources are requested for those services, they can get swapped (two CPUs, two different types of GPUs)
	- doesn't normally cause a huge issue as similar compute profiles are requested, but causes issues with unique resource requests
	- issues being addressed in core codebase, documentation to be published - potentially a breaking change for clients when moving to mainnet
- console: working on landing page, supporting a more AI-focused page (Github issues [100](https://github.com/akash-network/console/issues/100), [112](https://github.com/akash-network/console/issues/112))
- adding templates for all AI apps created in GPU testnet

Tyler:
- Github issue [104](https://github.com/akash-network/console/pull/104) - when documentation available, message to be put in #sig-clients for all changes across repos
- Artur from core team working on [akash-api](https://github.com/akash-network/akash-api), resource for client developers

### Cloudmos Update
Max:
- have been focused on GPU testnet
- added indexing for testnet analytics, added historical data for network capacity (daily snapshots, data is not on chain)

Tyler:
- internal testing for bug fixes on issue 104, might also fix 106
- technical insiders/vanguards to do extensive testing on bug fixes, changes
- testing of take pay/stable payments, will be part of mainnet updates soon
