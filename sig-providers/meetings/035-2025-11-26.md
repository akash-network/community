## Meeting Notes

### Core updates on recent provider-related issues and fixes

* Scott Carruthers opened the meeting and noted he was facilitating due to Tyler’s absence
* Scott Carruthers reported that a critical bug in the provider codebase was recently identified and resolved
* The issue caused bid activity to appear in provider logs without being written on-chain
* The bug was triggered when non-bid transactions were executed from provider accounts
* An example included transferring funds from provider wallets to personal addresses
* Affected providers previously needed to restart provider pods to recover
* The fix was completed the previous day
* A public announcement was planned following final release availability
* The issue was described as critical but affecting a limited subset of providers

### Provider codebase stability and release readiness

* Scott Carruthers addressed a previously reported issue involving scripts used to close stale bids
* The root cause was identified as an outdated SDK CLI version in the provider services binary
* The Akash binary supported this functionality earlier, while provider services did not
* The latest provider release includes the correct SDK version to resolve the issue
* These were identified as the primary provider-side blockers affecting the community
* Additional console-related issues discussed in SIG Support were also confirmed as resolved
* Deployment-closing issues were clarified as not being provider-side problems

### Provider Console updates

* Jigar Patel shared updates on recent Provider Console improvements
* The Provider Console was upgraded to support the latest main network version
* Providers running nodes within their own infrastructure can upgrade directly through the console
* The console now clearly indicates when a provider is out of date
* An upgrade to Cosmos SDK version fifty-three was completed
* Providers were advised to stay up to date to continue receiving console updates

### Provider Console analytics APIs

* Jigar Patel introduced newly released Provider Console APIs for provider analytics
* Providers can now retrieve detailed financial and operational data programmatically
* Available metrics include daily, weekly, and monthly revenue
* GPU utilization and net earnings after fees are included
* All data is accessible in structured JSON format
* Supporting work included indexer upgrades and improved revenue tracking logic
* Backend routes and public APIs were implemented with JWT authentication
* Rate limiting was added to ensure API stability
* A new console page allows providers to generate and manage API keys
* These APIs establish a foundation for future analytics features

### Release announcement and stability confirmation

* Scott Carruthers announced during the meeting that a new provider release was live
* Provider version 0.10.4 resolves the bid submission hang issue
* Helm chart updates and announcements were already prepared
* Jigar Patel noted that Provider Console updates would follow after internal validation
* Console update announcements will be shared in the support channel
* Scott Carruthers stated that the ecosystem was entering a period of stability
* No known critical breaking issues remain at this time

### Community discussion and closing

* Scott Carruthers opened the floor for community questions and additional updates
* No new issues were raised during the session
* Scott Carruthers confirmed that meeting artifacts would be published to GitHub
* The meeting concluded with appreciation for community participation

## Transcript


### **00:00:00**

**Scott Carruthers: \
**Okay. Hello everyone. Um so the SIG providers meeting for November 26. Um I mentioned earlier Tyler wasn’t able to join today. So I will run the meeting. Um and it may may be pretty quick. Um I just want to give one brief update. I’ll hand it then hand it over to the uh Akash provider console team with uh Deval and Jagar on the call. Um, also Zeke, um, from our core team may have some thoughts or updates as well. Um, and then obviously I can open it up to the community to see if anyone has any questions or other items to discuss.

So, kicking us off, um, we just came off of a SIG support meeting and I also mentioned uh, this matter in that meeting as well. Um, as of late yesterday, we the core team has solved a uh a bug in the provider codebase. Um and the the bug involved if any non uh provider uh bid transactions were conducted from the provider account, it would uh put the provider into a situation where you would see bid activity within the provider logs, but it actually wouldn’t write the bid to the blockchain. Um and we’d have to restart the provider pod to recover.

An example of this would be if a provider wanted to take profits out of their provider account and send it to um another non-provider personal address. If they did a transaction to do a bank send um from the provider account to another account, that would be an example of a non uh bid transaction that would um send the provider into the state that again you would see bids uh in the provider logs but not on the blockchain. Um so that issue was solved yesterday.

Um, and we’ll be making some announcements when the final release is available and ask uh community providers to start upgrading to that newest release. So, I don’t think this is actually an issue that a ton of providers encountered. Um, we were very cognizant of it internally. Um, but I don’t think a ton of community providers hit it, but I’m sure some did. Um, so again, this is kind of a rather critical issue that we just solved yesterday.


### **00:05:00**

**Scott Carruthers: \
**So um yeah, it’ll it’ll be um I don’t think there’s really any other um bugs that um need to be fixed. Yes. To that other issue that was just referred to. I’ve actually been in direct communication with a couple of community providers that were actively looking um for this because they have some scripts that close stale bids. So that issue was actually solved um some time ago um where you couldn’t do a transaction to close a bid um but our latest provider release didn’t have the proper SDK CLI version.

So long story short, you were able to do this for some time using the Akash binary um but it wasn’t possible in the provider services binary. Um but now as we release this new version um it’s going to have the proper and latest SDK version um to solve the issue that was referred to.

Okay. So I think from the core team um those were the two uh two rather significant prominent issues um that were plaguing the community. Um so I think that’s the updates that are top of mind for us. Um before I hand it over to Jagar and Deval for some provider console updates. Is there are there any other issues or uh things going on uh that anyone would like an update from the core team on?

Okay, I guess I’ll just this is SIG provider so it’s not uh directly related but coming out of SIG support there have been a number of console issues recently as well um so some issues of closing deployments which actually wasn’t a provider issue um but that issue has now been solved um as well. So not directly provider related but obviously something that’s impacting the community greatly.


### **00:10:00**

**Jigar Patel \
**Uh sure. Uh so majorly uh we have upgraded uh provider console to have latest uh network uh the main network upgrade available. So if your provider is running the node inside your own provider then you can upgrade through provider console. Uh so if you go to the settings uh and then you can upgrade it will show automatically that your provider is not up to date uh from the network standpoint.

Uh we also upgraded uh to SDK 53 as well. Uh if your provider is not updated please uh make sure that your provider is up to date because uh you’ll not able to get update if your provider is not up to date.

Uh and lastly I also want to talk uh a little bit about the console APIs that we have published. Uh basically providers now get real detailed data that they can pull directly into their own dashboard, BI tools or financial tools uh through the APIs. So we built a set of API endpoints uh that let them grab daily, weekly, monthly revenue uh GPU utilization and even the net earnings uh after the fees in a JSON format.

Uh getting this done required a lot of work across multiple systems. Uh first we upgraded the indexer. Uh then we added new logic to capture revenue and utilization much more precisely. Uh we added internal routes inside the console backend and built the public facing API layer with proper authentication using JWT and rate limiting.

Uh and also a brand new page allows providers to create API keys so they can automatically pull revenue data into dashboards and generate financial reports. Uh this was a major upgrade and sets us up for more analytics features in the future. So yeah that’s live right now.


### **00:15:00**

**Scott Carruthers: \
**All right great yeah thanks for all the updates. Any questions about the provider console or anything that was just covered?

Okay. Um so breaking news just while we’re on this call that the provider version that I was referring to that has a fix for provider becoming hung or not writing bids to the blockchain. Um that release has actually dropped since we’re on the call. Um, so that version is 0.10.4.

Um, and announcements and Helm chart updates are already prepared and will be going out to the community shortly. Um and again that will solve both those issues that we talked about before.

**Jigar Patel \
**Yeah. And uh for the provider console as well uh we’ll do initial testing and then release it to users. So we’ll announce it in the provider console support channel.

**Scott Carruthers: \
**Okay great. So that brings us to a period of stability. Um I don’t think we are aware of any critical breaking changes now. Um so let me open it back up to the floor again. Are there any issues that we haven’t discussed or any other updates anyone would like to provide or ask?

Okay, with that we’ll keep it short today. Um the call has been recorded and the transcript and notes will be posted in the GitHub repository shortly. Um thanks everyone for joining and we’ll call it good for now. Bye.
