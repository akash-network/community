### Andrew Mello presents updates on Akash OS development
- Akash OS is currently under development and is powering the largest provider in production on the Akash Network.
- It is designed to be an ISO or an image that can be installed on any machine, providing Ubuntu 22.04, a Kubernetes cluster, and a default account provider installation or configuration.
- New updates include the ability to deploy Akash OS to any machine without the need for an ISO, thanks to Ansible playbooks.
- The upcoming feature, Auto Port Forwarding, will automatically configure new providers with a public domain managed by akashos.com, reducing the barrier to entry for new providers.
- The goal is to make the configuration process seamless for new users and providers, minimizing the need for technical knowledge in networking, firewall setup, and DNS record management.
- A release around the first week of March is expected, making the onboarding process for new providers more straightforward.
- Akash Dash com, where providers can monitor their earnings, is ready for a Kepler integration.
- Providers will be able to claim their account by authenticating with their Kepler wallet, enabling features such as editing the page, setting up notifications, and having an account on Akash Dash com.
- Users and providers are encouraged to try out the new updates, dive into GitHub repos, and provide feedback to improve the tools and make them production-ready.
