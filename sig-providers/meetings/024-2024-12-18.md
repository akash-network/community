## **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG providers. It is December 18th, 2024. During the special interest group for providers participants from the Akash community come together to discuss all things related to the Akash provider.  that can be updated updates to the provider services etc. cooling for the provider. Over the last year plus we've been getting consistent updates on all things related to the work that Jigger and Dval have been doing.

Tyler Wright: previously they built a product called Pradoorf which was an easy way for people to build providers without having to use a CLI. on Akos again as of I think the last eight or nine months if not longer Jigger and Devon have been part of the core team taking Praor and building it into Akos console under some of the console 2.0 efforts.  I know at past meetings which you can find at GitHub inside the community repo you can find all meeting notes meeting transcripts meeting recordings from past sick providers meetings the Jigger and Dval have given updates on all the work that they've been doing related to again the kosh provider experience in console they gave a demo I think a couple of meetings ago we're going to get an update from Jigger and Deval

Tyler Wright: today. If there's any other topics that anybody wants to discuss related to the provider, please feel free to drop them inside of the chat. or again, if you're listening to this meeting, you're always more than welcome to name topics that you want to talk about during the SIG providers meeting in either the providers channel inside Discord the SIG providers channel inside Discord.  either one. again, you can get involved in and feel free to join these meetings or just mention topics that you want to be discussed by folks at these meetings if you can't make it yourself. With that being said, again if anybody has anything they want to talk about provider related, feel free to drop in the chat and we'll add it to the agenda.

Tyler Wright: But the first agenda item as always is just an update on all the efforts from Jigger and Dval. So I'll hand it over to them to give an update they've been doing as it pertains to the Akash provider experience in Akos console.

Jigar Patel: And yes we've been working on for quite some time for across over console and we have update today and we're going to show a demo. So let's just start with the demo. So it would be better to show everything on the screen. So I'm just going to present Let me know when you see the screen. Awesome.

Tyler Wright: I can see the screen now.

Jigar Patel: Yeah, as you can see from the menu bar, we have added quite a few different features into provider console from the last S provider meeting and I've been very excited to show this demo to everybody on the S provider. So, let's get started. I'm going to connect my wallet. It's going to ask me for approve ownership paper popup. I'm going to approve that. so if your wallet is a new obviously then you are an auto provider you will not see any dashboard right now. but you will get started page where we have some instruction what to start with the provider how much you need to start and then basic requirements some configuration some maturations.

Jigar Patel: So this is kind of like get started page where we walk through the new people who wants to become a provider and at the end this is just a u instructions page or you can see the guide for the new newer providers.  So when they click on the link provider obviously as familiar with this process we have quite bit updated the UI and some of the copy changes from last meeting plus I'm going to show you all these new features with the pricing at person storage and everything. So let's just start with the newer provider. this time we're going to make a multi-node provider.


### 00:05:00

Jigar Patel: last time we did a single node provider. So let's start with the three node providers. obviously it's going to ask you for the public IP for the first node and then all the nodes for private IPs for copy that. I'm going to close the file.  It's going to verify that if can access the node as well. So now yes obviously it was successful right so asking for mode 2 address this should be private IP address because all the connection between the okay 3s will happen on the private network. So we recommend that your nodes should be on the private network.

Jigar Patel: press that's how both system has designed right now.  So click that it's verifying. Yes. And it's verified. And for the third node, same thing. obviously you can use the copy over button. So it will copy over your file or password or your SS you root username. Quick cash.  think it for main name I'm going to use advance.

Jigar Patel: Obviously you can add as many attributes as that added here right and we have standardized attributes from I think sig analytics that came out the standardized attributes so we are using that so CPU architecture GPU what kind of GPU model you have right and more plus if you

Jigar Patel: want to add anything which is not in the list you can add unknown attributes basically it will ask you for the key and the value okay basically like that right and then you can put a custom key and value for that as well I'm not going to do that for the demo but let's continue for the pricing this is a standard pricing that we basically use from our documentation right but this is all means

Jigar Patel: every user can change it right let's say I wanted to put 150 core GPU permit is expensive right then I can do that plus you can also see all the no combined resources right so if you have eight GPUs per node if you are putting eight different servers then you will see 64 GPUs here right and based on  this numbers we are calculating the estimate monthly earnings based on the value that you have put the same way for wallet import there's two way you can do the manual way which is run some commands in your command line and then we verify that your wallet is imported successfully and then you can continue.

Jigar Patel: there is also an auto mode right autoimp import which will take your seed phrase and encry to end to your server and then do the wallet import just going to use that for now copy my surface and then at this level our whole process starts right and you will see right away once the wallet has imported so what we do is we import the wallet and then we start creating the cases and all these other processes that happens under this border right and as you can see our activity log has started. you can also track all those activities.

Jigar Patel: basically if you have more nodes then you'll see more joining work or node actions here more installed GPU drivers on unable devices or servers it will install GPU drivers and potentially restart those servers as well but you'll see everything here meanwhile once it's doing its thing I can show you  I have created another provider to show the other things like pricing and attributes and stuff like that. So let me just log out from this one and switch to other wallet on whilst that's running I can connect to the different wallet. Yeah.


### 00:10:00

Jigar Patel: So this is online. I just created this provider 2 minutes ago. So now it's online. and you can see the activity logs is like let's say if I'm changing any pricing. So let's just go there, right? Let's just change the pricing. Let's say something happened there. I need to connect my wallet. Let me do that. So this way you can connect your control machine to the provider console and then you will able to access all these features. Right? So let's say provider project right.

Jigar Patel: So, I set it as a $200 for this provider, Let me just change that to 250, right? And if I go to 8 for pricing% storage I don't have storage for maybe right and as you can see it changes my monthly Click next. this will change the pro pricing for it.  And there you can see that has changed. If I go to activity logs as you can see there is update provider priving activity that happened two seconds ago right basically it will just show what kind of a process that happened on your provider.

Jigar Patel: So if I go to attributes as you can see I have some attributes I can delete and basically what it will do it will actually change the attribute and restart the provider right it just takes some time to reflect on the blockchain and then we are also using console APIs but you'll see that process happen  inactivity logs for a person storage. so basically what it's doing right now is actually checking all the nodes all the servers you have and all the row unforatted drives on those servers. once you have that you can just select those and then you'll able to create a percent storage. note that you will only able to select one type of u drives.

Jigar Patel: So let's say on server one you have SSDs.  Server two you have NVMEs and server three you have HDDs or there is numerous different servers and different types of HDD as SSD NVME you have then if you wanted to create a U person storage able to let's say if you select NVME then you can only select NVME from all the drives or all the servers but not HDD or SSDs if you select SSDs  And obviously vice versa you cannot select the other way because that's how the person sort works right you are only able to allow to add one type of drives into person storage.

Jigar Patel: Yeah, select this enable personal storage and it'll just start that process basically, So if I go there, right, it'll just start that process, Go in the settings obviously it will evolve over the time but from here you can restart provider there if you will able to upgrade provider from here.  Currently we don't have any upgrades right now but you will able to upgrade your provider from here. and obviously you can change your provider URL and obviously this is a dashboard which shows your earnings and resources list resources and everything else.


### 00:15:00

Jigar Patel: So let me go back to the one. I think the node is catching up on that right there on that.

Deval Patel: Yeah.

Jigar Patel: Yeah. Also one more thing you will able to see the statuses on the left side still online obviously you will see if your pro is online or if your control machine is control node is connected or not we are basically not actually storing anything on the backend side where everything showing on the front end. So we don't have any information from we don't store any sensitive information on our side. Right.

Jigar Patel: Also for audit because this provider is not audited you can basically click this button allow to request audit. this is basically to show it's just a general way right now how audits working. you should create u issue with all the information for your provider. this is the process right now.  Obviously, we'll improve that in a future upgrades. yeah, so that should be for the deployments, I'm currently not have any deployments right now, but obviously we will show all the deployments that happened on this provider or any pro active as well, right?

Jigar Patel: maybe if I go back to another world. So just give me one second maybe this project is online and I can see if we have any deployments there and I can show you how the deployments and deployment details page looks  Okay, this provider is online as you can see update provider domain we tested this functionality on this provider.

Jigar Patel: So you see in 2D logs you will see that action happened and deployments we don't require any but probably inactive we have so I deployed this lease all this deployment so you will see so right now it's closed but you'll see on created what was the runtime how much it was transferred and how much they got least from the provider. So yeah that's for the deployment. I think I have covered everything. Any questions?

Jigar Patel: please.

Tyler Wright: Thank you. Jigger and Deval, does anyone have any questions about the demo that they just saw from Jigger and  Correct me if I'm wrong, Jigger, but I believe the next step is you would like, folks from the community to do some testing and you'll give access to people when you all are ready to, test out building providers and test out the functionality throughout. is that the goal over the next couple of weeks?

Jigar Patel: So we wanted to so parties interested any community member who are interested in testing this product please reach out to me or Tyler or anybody from the community in the discord right in a provider the channel right probably and right we would like to start beta testing right and see if we find any bugs  So here and there and try to fix it before we push it to the bigger audience for sure. That's the goal. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Thank you again. again, if anybody wants to test out any of the functionality demo today, please reach out to Jigger, Dval, myself, anybody and we can, point you in the right direction of getting you access. Jigger, I apologize if you already mentioned this, but is this experience designed for folks that are building new providers right now, or is it something that existing providers can kind of import their wallet and be able to kind of manage their provider from this experience? go ahead, Dval. Sorry.


### 00:20:00

Deval Patel: So, this building a provider experience is for the new providers as for sure, but the existing providers can utilize the u things like at changing attributes or changing price definitely. so yeah, those kind of things they can do with the existing product.

Jigar Patel: So to add to that we actually like our goal from moving the operator to provide console was one of the bigger thing that we were doing our own thing and…

Tyler Wright: Amazing.

Jigar Patel: kind of we were following but we had separate paths with the Akash official document and our way of doing that right but now what we have done is we definitely  like going with the core team user route right so everything if you have existing provider you can just connect a wallet and if you want to change let's say pricing right just connect your control node and then you able to change the pricing you're able to change the attributes even like you able to enable the person storage from here as well right you'll able to you will able to see the deployments detail on from that right only the thing that not will be available is create a new provider, But if you are already provided then you will not able to see that button there. Right?

Jigar Patel: but let's say if you just wanted to create a new provider then by all use this

Tyler Wright: I saw a hand up for a second, but I believe it's gone. does anyone else have any questions or comments about just all the work being done? Go ahead, Andrea.

Andrey Arapov: Yeah, great job. Digar, I just wanted to add one note based on some experience that I've been through recent weeks. there so some providers they are running most of their deployments they have in USDC.  So they're settled they're paying basically in USDC and if provider doesn't have enough and it can basically just run out of AD which cause the provider P will restart. Just something that to be aware for everyone who is running provider.  Make sure to top up and monitor for now manually the AQ balance because if all of your leases are being paid in USDC stable coin it can run out of basically I was thinking maybe you should put it in on dboard so it's more visible or have some notification but it's like thinking for future that's

Jigar Patel: Yes, absolutely. that's a great feedback Andre and me and they were talking about this yesterday as well, right? That we should put something there, right? And then we'll just add on GitHub issue and then we'll start work on that soon.

Andrey Arapov: Sauce Grace.

Tyler Wright: Thank you very much for for others that may be dealing with that same thing.

Andrey Arapov: Yeah, no problem.

Tyler Wright: I just want to No,…

Andrey Arapov: It was quite interesting to find it out because we were thinking why provider port is restarting and then there is a consequence mismatch. Okay, but why it's happening and then because the very first transaction it was a list withdrawal transaction which failed and because it broke the account sequence number internal logic which is still to the addressed and that's why it was looping.  So always check the imbalance.

Tyler Wright: it's really interesting again as a network continues to evolve and change, new issues present themselves and we just got to continue to ify make it easy for others to understand those issues and then, communicate

Tyler Wright: them clearly so that again fewer people face them in the future. So much appreciate you Andra. Is there anything else that anybody wants to discuss that to pertain to the Akash provider? Cool. The only thing that I'll mention, I think we mentioned this in steering committee and a couple other calls.  I know members of the core team are continuing to look at provider stability and specifically pod stability inside the provider. I know there have been some behaviors that have been traditional and have been on purpose as it pertains to the network in terms of how leases are kind of managed and closed based upon certain behaviors.


### 00:25:00

Tyler Wright: As the network continues to mature and grow, I know the core engineering team has been rethinking some of that behavior through increase against pod stability with new and different types of deployments being again deployed on the AOS network. so pod stability is something that is high up on the product and engineering roadmap and something that the core engineering team has been focused on for the past couple of months. there have been some testing done to again updates on the provider. Once those tests have been adequately done by the members of the core team and then members of the Akos community specifically insiders that again are already in there and the core team already has a great relationship with.

Tyler Wright: Then there may be some announcements in the r discord channel for some again provider updates. So this is something that again the core engineering team has been working based upon some behaviors that we've seen with specific clients and again it's just been a big focus on just increased pod stability for the provider.  So look out for announcements on testing for those that may get involved there and look out for announcements on application for all providers in the coming weeks month etc. So that's just another item that the core team has been working on. I just want to see if there's anything else provider related that anybody wants to discuss at this time. Cool.

Tyler Wright: If not, then again, it's been an action-packed year as it pertains to SIG providers. I really do appreciate everyone's participation in 2024, looking to really grow this sick providers group as the network continues to grow. I know there's a number of people that have feature ideas, have ways that they want to improve the provider experience. please get involved in the  There's a providers build channel for those that are looking to build providers on the AOSH network. There's a sik providers channel where you can get involved in things related to meetings. but again, please feel free to make your voice heard if you have any issues that you face. Again, there's Aos insiders and vanguards that can help solve any issues that you might be having related to the provider.

Tyler Wright: And then again if the issue persists then you can add it to the support repo where all issues related to the core kosh blockchain and core product live. So again please I really do appreciate everyone's participation. Please look to stay involved. I hope everybody has a great holiday season and we will see you at the next SIG providers monthly meeting in January 2025.  Much appreciate you all. Hope everyone has a great rest of their day and we'll talk soon for sure. Bye-bye.

Deval Patel: Thank you, Tyler.

Rodri R: Same guy. Merry Christmas.

Zeke Ezagui: Thanks.

Rodri R: He wouldn't talk before.

Jigar Patel: Thanks.
