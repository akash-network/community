## Meeting Notes
- **Tyler Wright's Opening:**
  - Discussed updates regarding Akash Console 2.0, focusing on provider developments.
  - Invited Jigar and Deval to provide a status update on the ongoing work around Akash Console.

- **Jigar Patel's Update:**
  - Akash Console is undergoing internal testing with a multi-node structure.
  - Praetor tool is being integrated into Akash Console 2.0.
  - Migration for single-node users will be smoother, but multi-node users will require resource adjustments.
  - They expect to move to beta testing soon and will update the provider channel once it's ready.

- **Deval Patel's Remarks:**
  - No significant migration challenges expected for providers, especially if using Kubernetes.
  - Future upgrades will simplify processes, particularly for multi-node setups.

- **Robert Del Rey's Query:**
  - Asked about key features in Praetor that should be tested by the Zealy working group.
  - Jigar recommended focusing on testing the new provider console instead of Praetor since the transition to Akash Console is underway.
  - They agreed to collaborate on creating relevant missions for Zealy users to test new features in Akash Console.

- **Andrew Mello's Contribution:**
  - Raised two points:
    1. **Provider Issue:** Ongoing issue where non-schedulable nodes still bid on the network. Awaiting triage from the engineering team.
    2. **Discount Scheme:** Implemented a staking-based discount scheme for providers, allowing users to receive discounts based on their staked Akt.
       - Suggested it could be highlighted in a blog for wider awareness. Tyler agreed to follow up on this.
  
- **GPU Labeling & Scaling Concern (Andrew Mello):**
  - Criticized the manual process of labeling GPUs, calling for automation using Nvidia APIs.
  - Warned that the current approach could hinder scalability, especially as the provider network grows.
  - Tyler acknowledged the concern and promised to follow up with the core engineering team for clarification and feedback on why the automated solution wasn’t pursued.

- **Open Discussion:**
  - Tyler reminded participants to check the provider announcements channel regularly for updates.
  - Discussed a recent message about the “Kill zombie parent script” in the provider announcements channel.

- **Closing Remarks by Tyler Wright:**
  - Action items from the meeting will be followed up in subsequent SIG meetings or asynchronously in relevant channels.
  - Thanked everyone for their participation and reminded them of the steering committee meeting happening the next day.

## Action Items
- **Jigar & Deval:** Continue testing Akash Console 2.0 and provide updates to the provider channel as the beta phase approaches.
- **Tyler Wright:** Follow up with Andrew on the discount scheme blog post and ensure its wider publication.
- **Tyler Wright:** Provide clarification on the decision to avoid Nvidia API integration for GPU labeling.
- **Andrew Mello:** Reshare details of the staking-based discount scheme with Tyler for further review and publication.
- **All Providers:** Regularly check the provider announcements channel for important updates.
