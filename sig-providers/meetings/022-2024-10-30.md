# **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG providers monthly meeting on October 30th, 20 During the SIG providers monthly meetings, this group usually goes over anything related to the provider. obviously we have the provider channel and discord. documentation available but any active or live discussions that anybody wants to have regarding anything aos provider related we usually talk about during this monthly meeting. One of the standing agenda items historically has been updates from all the work that Jigger and Dval have been doing in creating Praor as of the last six months.

Tyler Wright: I believe at this point again the Prador team is now under Overclock labs and has been actively working on the Akash console and a provider experience inside a console. usually we talk to or we get updates from Jigger and Dval and all the work that they've been doing around console 2.0 and the Kosh provider on console. I know there's also been a HIP 02 proposal that is now on chain up for vote. I think some folks may be joining to talk about that. But if anybody has any other agenda items or anything else related to the provider that they want to discuss here today, please drop a note inside the chat and we can get to any of those topics.

Tyler Wright: there's enough folks from the core team here that can answer any questions if With that said, I'll kick it over to Jigger and Dval because I know there's a number of updates that they've been working on related to Akash console and the provider on console. So, I'll kick it over to them to give us an update on all the work that they've been

Jigar Patel: Thanks Hey, so I wanted to start with the updates from u work that has been ongoing for provider console beta. and we have created PR and it's on the review right now and I also wanted to demo something today. if everybody agrees on that. Awesome. let me share my screen.

Jigar Patel: Hope you can see the so basically this is a new provider console. and obviously it will be improved over the time. currently a lot of work is on ongoing right now but let's start with building a provider on it. so first you connect the wallet and obviously you can use caper or lip wallet. so if I use kapper it gives me approve ownership popup. I'm going to approve that.

Jigar Patel: you might not able to see that pop up but yeah and on this wallet I'm not a provider so it will give me u become pro tab so on Okay. Maybe our node is a little bit behind me.

Jigar Patel: I just created this wallet and it might not reflect the AD I just sent. yeah so once you wanted to become a provider you can just select the provider you can select the number of servers.


### 00:05:00

Jigar Patel: So we just removed selecting single and multiload because now we use K3S on both single load and multiload. So you can select how many number of server you want and we'll install K3S on all of them and make a Kubernetes on it. So if you select one for now going to okay and then give your information about the control machine. So let me just copy file to the file next.

Jigar Patel: So basically it's verifying the access to it. and we'll ask for give the domain name. Then email is optional. Next attribute I can set location region if I want. so central hit here I can set the pricing.

Jigar Patel: so based on the resources I have so I have four CPU 15 gigs of memory or 16 but one gigs the system takes it storage and the GPU and because I have a GPU right it'll show up the GPU pricing so let's say if I wanted to do 200 on GPU it'll just show me estimated monthly earnings next it will show a password mode or just this be importing wallet. so I'll select the wallet mode and then just copy my website. this is not the one. I just changed my yeah. Yeah. So was the one. Yeah.

Jigar Patel: So now our building process started and it'll just initialize the G3S and we'll updated the system installing the G clico updating Kubernetes. So we'll just do all this and you say in 13 seconds we installed the Kubernetes on control node. and I'll just go back and change to other wallet or let me just go back to homepage because we are just installing Kubernetes. So we might have a dashboard for it. and you can see it like this is running right now. so if your provider is not online you'll able to see your dashboard look like this.

Jigar Patel: Basically, it says your code is offline and if your board is online, which is I'm just going to try to find something that is online Yeah, it is online, So, you'll able to see the dashboard, you'll see all the deployments. and then more feature are coming soon. we are adding settings for changing attributes.

Jigar Patel: those are coming soon you'll able to see that your conforming is connected or not and you are able to create a new wallets on it sorry a new multi-node cluster from it as well. yeah we'll push this update soon after the P merge into beta and we'll open it to testing for public. Thank you. So yeah, that was update from my


### 00:10:00

Tyler Wright: Thank you very much. I know again a significant amount of work has gone into that from again the console team and other members of the core team that have been supporting. So thank you very much. Cool. a couple of things that we've always touched on again as Jigger has mentioned today and in previous meetings much of the way that providers are being built now is as a result of a updated process that the core engineering team but mostly efforts kind of led by Scott have updated to again the way that the provider

Tyler Wright: This has done wonders in speaking of speed in which providers can be built. and so again there's documentation that's available to those it's not the documentation that's on the site is still in beta right now. very much like the work from Digger and Dval related to the provider on AOS console. if anybody wants to again build the provider in the beta way, please recap. You can also use the documentation that's available in the Kosh docs. but again all that will be updated in the coming weeks or months as we continue to test and again there's been tests going on for at least six months with this new way to build the so again we have a large sample size of provider stability and all that kind of stuff.

Tyler Wright: So again, much appreciate the efforts of many folks on this call for all they've done. Any questions on the provider experience on the Akash council? All right. I know some folks who traditionally come to this meeting have conflicts coming out of some other calls. One thing I do want to point out again, there is a pro proposal on chain for the provider incentives pilot number two. This is off of the back of again the first pilot I'm dropping in the GitHub discussion for folks.

Tyler Wright: if anybody has any questions about the pilot number two how the funds will be used please feel free to drop in a message inside of that GitHub discussion. we might also take some time potentially during steering committee if anybody has any follow-up questions that they might have and they want to talk about it live. Terrific. Is there any other topics that anybody on this call wants to talk about? Go ahead, Scott.

Scott Carruthers: So I wanted to ensure that everyone on this call was clear especially for those supporting provider builds like Rodri and others in the community and the impact and the use of our AOSH recent introduction of trial instances and possibly some others will have some thoughts on this as well but I'll kick it off.

Scott Carruthers: so for anyone that's not aware the AOS console recently introduced trial accounts so this is very much akin or synonymous with AWS free tier right so a brand new user to AOS maybe a non-crypto user this wants to experiment with AOS deployments just like they want to experiment with virtual machines on AWS we want to give the ability for someone to easily get started and

Scott Carruthers: do some initial experimentation on AOS and then eventually obviously if they like the experience and AOSH fits their needs and they would transition out of the trial accounts to paid accounts just as you would in AWS or other cloud environments. The reason I bring this up on this call I are twofold. one I just want to ensure that everyone is aware currently trial accounts are restricted to providers that are on a white list. so obviously if someone is spinning up a cost trial, we want to ensure that they're running on our most stable so we have a white list of providers that, are the targets for trial deployments. so first of all, I just want to make sure everyone was clear on that.

Scott Carruthers: and then second and again in support of the community I've recently started getting some questions about increased bid because there's so much activity around I think trial accounts are being very eagerly anticipated and I think the community is very excited to use user accounts when seeing a flood of new activity that increases the bid activity on the network.


### 00:15:00

Scott Carruthers: so if we have any providers that are curious about increased bid activity and we would obviously have to dig into on a individual basis to see if a provider is wondering why there's increased bid activity. We'd have to validate that it's because of trial counts or possibly it could be for some other reason but I've recently heard or fielded some questions on increased bid activity because of trial accounts. let me know if there's any questions on this, but that's basically the two points that I want to make. So, first of all, I just want to make sure that everyone is aware of trial accounts on the AOS network. and that they're currently limited to providers that exist on a white list. I think we're kind of in the mode right now that if other community providers want to be included on that white list, we're willing to entertain that.

Scott Carruthers: 

Scott Carruthers: So we do have some community providers on that white list currently and we're open to including others so obviously it's a trial account, but the provider is still realizing profits. if a trial account lands on your provider so it's not like the provider would be hosting free compute at that point. They would actually be compensated in AKT just as they would from any other deployment. So again, the two points that I wanted to make was just one, make sure everyone was aware of trial accounts and its impact on providers and the provider white list and also some increased bid activity on the network. Any questions about trial accounts or any of the provider related bits that I just talked about?

Tyler Wright: 

Scott Carruthers: Yeah, if there's no questions, I think that's it.

Scott Carruthers: And I don't think I have outside of trial accounts, I don't think I have anything else at the moment.

Tyler Wright: Thank you very much,…

Tyler Wright: Just I know that there's a number of moving parts that are happening soon. obviously with trial wallets, fiat payments, the console experience, all the updates there happening on both the deployment side and on the provider side is Jigger and Deval just walked us through. there's a Cosmos SDK upgrade in the works and again there's some testing that is begun and will continue to happen over the next couple of weeks and beyond. I would just ask anybody listening to this or anybody here today. Again, make sure that you keep reminders on and notifications on especially for channels like the provider announcement channel.

Tyler Wright: I know that Andre and others share date announcements there. Again, if there's any changes that need to be made across the provider or any call outs usually we put those we put those call outs there because obviously it's a permissionless network people giving their emails not always required. So, yeah, again, if anybody has anything, please please make sure that you look out for those announcement channels and stay up to date on all things there. Cool. All right.

Tyler Wright: 

Tyler Wright: I know we've gone through the agenda and gotten some updates on Akos console and on provider side from Jigger and Dval. Scott went through a bunch of announcements that he's been seeing over the last couple of days related to trial wallets. again, I just want to see if there's any other topics that anybody wants to bring up. I know we've been on here for a little over 20 minutes. but just want to see if there's anything else that anybody wants to talk about at this time. I'm going to take that silence as cool.

Andrew Mello: 

Tyler Wright: Go ahead, Andrew. Yes,…

Andrew Mello: Can you hear me now?

Tyler Wright: can hear you

Andrew Mello: Okay, great. I just wanted to follow up on the tainted nodes bidding issue that I had brought up on September 18th. that is still an open issue it looks like and that was kind of a priority issue because it affects any user deploying for the first time on a Kosh could potentially hit this bug which leads to a failed deployment. So it's kind of like a critical path that we'd want to make sure is working.


### 00:20:00

Andrew Mello: And so that's issue number 253 in

Tyler Wright: Yes, I can drop in a note.

Tyler Wright: And so I apologize for not doing this beforehand. this is something we talked about in SIG support. We've, triaged it and this is a priority issue. There's just a number of other issues that have become higher priority over the last couple of months related to pod stability, related to some other things that again while this is a priority there's other things that have trumped it over the last couple of weeks. the goal is to get back to it very shortly but we're trying to work through some other related issues.

Tyler Wright: 

Tyler Wright: I know again we talked about this in SIG support the core engineering team is only so large and so again we're trying to push through as many issues but I can drop a note in issue number 253 in the support repo to just make sure that it continues to get the attention that it should get.

Andrew Mello: 

Tyler Wright: But again, there's just not enough time and there's a couple other issues that have been more critical that the core engineering team has been focused on.

Andrew Mello: So I just wanted to again put it out there so it's on the record that this does affect the first deployment experience for any user and…

Andrew Mello: again thus I thought it should be looked at again. in addition to that I was going to file a new operator inventory bug. I cannot find stability with mixed GPUs.

Andrew Mello: in the showing of available versus allocatable. I'm having this issue particularly on again clusters with mixed models. not just one model in a cluster and I'll be filing that today as So again more operator inventory issues.

Tyler Wright: Thank you, Andrew, for identifying those and again u much appreciate when you make these issues. we'll look out for that issue and then again triage it like we have another great call Andrew maybe for you to come to if you have availability is a sick support call to talk a little bit more about these but much appreciate you bringing these up and s providers and then again we'll make sure these get u attention.

Andrew Mello: All right, sounds good. Yeah, I'll see if I can get added to that sixport calendar invite. Thanks.

Tyler Wright: Excellent. We'll do. Is there anything else that anybody wants to talk about related to the provider on If not then again we'll follow up with some updates in the provider announcements channel and elsewhere as they are made available. So again please look out for those channels if you haven't already. I think Andrew is again going to file a bug related to the inventory operator. so we'll look out for that issue and then again I'll make sure that Andrew is added to the six support call and we can talk a little bit more specifics about triaging and some of the other things Much appreciate the update from Jigger and Dval. again look out from for continued updates testing coming soon.

Tyler Wright: If anybody has any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out in the six providers or the providers discord channel or elsewhere. But much appreciate everyone's time today and thank you to all those that are listening later. I hope everyone has a great rest of their day and we'll continue to talk online. But thank you all for the updates and the information.

Andrey Arapov: Thanks everyone.

Tyler Wright: Appreciate you all. Bye-bye.
