## Meeting notes

**Welcome and Introduction:**
  - Tyler Wright opened the meeting, highlighting the purpose and past contributions of the group.
  - Emphasis on the collaborative nature and outcomes from previous meetings.

**Updates from Previous Meeting:**
- **Praetor Provider App Update:**
  - Jigar Patel and Deval Patel provided updates on the Praetor provider app now integrated into the open-source console.
  - Monthly updates on the app's development were mentioned.

- **Console 2.0 Updates:**
  - Continued development and integration into Console 2.0.
  - Scottâ€™s scripts for K3s multi-node setups were discussed and found promising after comprehensive testing.

- **Tooling Updates for Active Providers:**
  - Damir Simpovic discussed new tools for active providers.
  - Updates and improvements on tooling from previous presentations.

- **Provider Build Improvements:**
  - Scott Carruthers provided updates on provider build scripts, their usage, and future plans.
  - Community feedback on build script improvements was acknowledged.

**Additional Discussion:**
- **Provider Build Scripts:**
  - Scott Carruthers mentioned that the provider build scripts have been stable for the past 1.5 to 2 months.
  - Jigar and Deval Patel, along with community members like Zeke and Andrey, have tested these scripts and provided feedback.
  - Scripts are now being used more widely and tested for various setups (e.g., GPU providers, persistent storage).
  - The next milestone is the Praetor team's implementation of these scripts within their Akash provider build process.
  - Future steps include gathering community feedback and potentially making these scripts the default recommended provider build process.
  - Scott shared the engineering documentation link for those interested in experimenting with the scripts.

- **K8 vs. K3s Discussion:**
  - Zeke E inquired about the differences between K8 and K3s, and any limitations of K3s.
  - Scott Carruthers explained that K3s is a lightweight distribution of Kubernetes, making installation faster and management easier, especially in multi-node environments.
  - No significant limitations were identified in K3s compared to K8, making it suitable for Akash providers.
  - Andrey Arapov added that K3s simplifies the deployment process and saves time, though there are minor operational differences. 

**Additional Discussion Points:**
- **Andrew Mello's Concerns:**
  - Andrew Mello joined the meeting late and expressed concerns about the new operator inventory.
  - He highlighted issues with the operator inventory being unstable and heavily reliant on the Kubernetes cluster's availability.
  - Specifically, he mentioned issues with using a database backend instead of local etcd, handling node state changes, and encountering errors leading to an empty status page.
  - Andrew detailed a support issue regarding pod name length exceeding the 63-character limit and mentioned upcoming tickets related to etcd leader changes and other instability issues.

**Scott Carruthers' Response:**
  - Scott Carruthers acknowledged the concerns and explained the motivation behind the operator inventory updates.
  - The updates aimed to improve GPU inspection and indexing, necessary for provider incentives.
  - Scott emphasized the importance of discovering edge cases and encouraged Andrew to file detailed bug reports.
  - He assured that an update regarding the hostname length issue would be provided by the end of the day.

**Key Points from Andrew Mello:**
  - The operator inventory's current architecture makes it fragile, especially in multi-node environments.
  - Issues arise when nodes go offline, change state, or when the etcd leader changes.
  - He stressed the need for more robust testing and handling of cluster state changes to ensure stability.
  - The operator inventory currently opens a listening service on a specific port, which breaks if the port becomes unavailable, leading to the system not resetting itself properly.

**Scott Carruthers' Clarification:**
  - Scott provided context on the operator inventory's design, explaining the setup of a gRPC endpoint for constant GPU inspection.
  - He acknowledged the need for validating and investigating the issues Andrew raised, particularly the etcd leader change.
  - Scott reassured that the core team would address the issues as they are reported.

**Closing Remarks:**
- Tyler Wright thanked Andrew Mello for raising his concerns and emphasized the importance of community feedback in improving the system.
- He reiterated the value of these calls for discussing updates, new tooling, and addressing provider-related issues on the Akash Network.
- The meeting concluded with an invitation for any additional agenda items or concerns from other participants.

## Action Items
- Andrew Mello to file detailed bug reports regarding the operator inventory issues.
- Scott Carruthers to provide an update on the hostname length issue and investigate other reported problems.
- The core team to monitor and validate reported issues, providing timely updates and solutions.
- Encourage community members to report issues and provide feedback to improve the operator inventory and overall system stability.
