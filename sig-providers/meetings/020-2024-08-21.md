## Meeting notes
- **Praetor App and Console 2.0 Integration:**
  - Jigar Patel provided updates on the progress of integrating the provider process into Console 2.0.
  - The current focus is on transitioning from k2 to k3s, improving the visual and functional flow for users managing Akash providers.
  - The new scripts developed for Praetor are being tested internally, showing positive results. These scripts ensure compatibility for both multi-node and single-node setups on k3s.
  - There is excitement about moving these changes into production. The new Console 2.0 dashboard will include features such as real-time lease monitoring, CPU and memory utilization statistics, and financial data related to leases.
  - The upcoming version 0.6.4 of Praetor will support easy upgrades from version 6.2. The update is expected to roll out shortly, and feedback from the community will be sought to refine the experience further.

- **Snapshot Service Integration and Helm Chart Updates:**
  - Zeke E highlighted the need to update the Helm charts on GitHub to incorporate the new snapshot service, which provides hourly snapshots. This service is expected to enhance the speed of environment setups and testing for Akash providers.
  - Scott Carruthers suggested a cautious approach to adopting the new snapshot service as the default in Helm charts. He recommended a testing period to ensure there are no connectivity or stability issues before making it the default.
  - Andrey Arapov supported the idea of a testing phase and suggested updating the Helm charts after verifying the snapshot service's reliability.

- **Migrating from K8s to K3s**:
  - Zeke E asked about documentation and support for migrating from a K8s setup to K3s.
  - Andrey Arapov explained that while technically possible, such migrations could be complex due to differences in container runtimes, configuration files, and networking setups.
  - He suggested that in most cases, it might be easier to announce a maintenance window and rebuild the cluster rather than migrate.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Rodri R pointed out that some sections of the provider documentation, particularly those related to hardware requirements, are outdated and need revisions.
  - Tyler Wright agreed and mentioned that this would be added as an action item. There will likely be a pull request (PR) made to update the documentation to reflect current needs accurately.

- **Community Acknowledgement and Support:**
  - Tyler Wright expressed appreciation for the continuous support provided by community members like Andrey, Scott, Tampa, and Deathless, who actively engage in the provider channels to assist new users and share their expertise.
  - Deathless was specifically mentioned for his ongoing support in answering questions, sharing success stories, and helping new members navigate the provider landscape.

- **Cosmos SDK 47 Testnet Participation:**
  - Tyler Wright invited participants to join the testnet for the upcoming Cosmos SDK 47 upgrade. This testnet aims to thoroughly test the network, review documentation, and ensure all components function correctly.
  - Participants with available bandwidth are encouraged to get involved. AKT rewards are available for those who contribute significantly to the testing efforts.
  - Interested individuals should contact Tyler Wright or express their interest in the public channels. Announcements and updates related to the testnet will be shared soon.
**Next Steps:**
- Monitor the implementation and testing of the new snapshot service and any updates from the Praetor team.
- Ensure timely updates to the provider documentation.
- Engage with the community to gather feedback on new features and encourage participation in testnet activities.

**Closing:**
- Tyler Wright thanked all attendees for their contributions and ongoing support. 
- He encouraged continued collaboration in the provider channels and reminded everyone to stay tuned for updates on the snapshot service and upcoming testnet activities. 
- The meeting concluded with expressions of gratitude from several participants.

## **Action Items:**
- **Jigar Patel & Deval Patel**:
  - Continue working on the integration of the Praetor app into Console 2.0.
  - Prepare and communicate the release of Praetor version 0.6.4, encouraging community members to test and provide feedback.

- **Zeke E**:
  - Proceed with plans to update the GitHub repository for Helm charts with the new snapshot service, following a period of testing to ensure stability and functionality.
  - Monitor the performance and reliability of the snapshot service, and report any issues encountered during testing.

- **Scott Carruthers & Andrey Arapov**:
  - Participate in the testing of the new snapshot service as part of the Cosmos SDK 47 testnet activities.
  - Decide on the appropriate timing to update Helm charts based on test outcomes and community feedback.

- **Tyler Wright**:
  - Ensure that documentation updates are prioritized and completed, possibly through submitting a pull request.
  - Facilitate community involvement by sharing resources and updates related to the new snapshot service and other developments.
  - Coordinate feedback and participation for the Cosmos SDK 47 testnet and engage with interested community members.

- **All Providers**:
  - Review the new Console 2.0 dashboard features when they become available and provide feedback.
  - Continue engaging in community discussions and provide support to new users and other providers.
