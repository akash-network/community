## Notes

- Jigar thanked Shimpa, Andy, Anil, Scott, and others for all of their help with testing.
- Jigar is investigating issues around whitelisting that will have
- Praetor will continue to work on content moderation.
- Old providers that are not in Helm will have an upgrade path, so they can be on helm based.
- Jigar asked if the upgrade communication can be improved, so that Praetor users can have upgrade more quickly.
- Post any upgrade communication to the private praetor channel.
- Starting at Mainnet, Praetor can check what kind of GPUs a user has outside of the attributes.
- The Praetor team has added some fields to their [provider status page](https://akash.praetorapp.com/provider-status?chainid=testnet-02), including GPU type and number of GPUs.
- Adding a way where Praetor can reach out to those providing. This will be an Optional field for providers. This is so that Praetor can reach out to the provider for anything like an Upgrade, feature improvements, etc.
- Anil believes that this is a great idea, because this is a way to be able to reach out to providers for time sensitive needs.
- Anil talked about the uptime of the provider. Some of the target audience may want to put GPUs on the marketplace during a certain period. Anil wants to see if there is a UX solve for those that want to turn on a provider for certain times, so that deployer knows
- Anil wants to have some sort of function to kick off deployers when the provider is going offline during a scheduled time.
- Deval like this idea for an audience of providers. Right now, you can use Provider "notes" to share that information.
- Scheduling of provider on time should on the provider.
- Damir mentioned that deployers would avoid providers without 100% uptime. The tenants may NOT be aware that some providers are not up all the time on purpose.
- Anil hears what Damir is saying about uptime. Clients also need to make it very clear that some providers will come offline at a certain
- Scott talked about bringing GPU spot cycles on Akash. Still need a lot of design consideration for this.
- Scott also clarified that the uptime is not affected, it is the inventory that will be affected. 
- Jigar agrees with Scott that GPU spot instances is the best route for time based providers. Users may be more used to this kind of behavior, because the price may be cheaper for those GPU instances.
- Anil clarified that this work is less on the provider side, and more on the client side.
- Anil mentioned that Overclock is trying to bootstrap demand and supply on the network.
- Initially this may be a manual process, but this is essential for Akash to have a steady state of deployments and p
- Deval asked if there is a timeline of the GPUs on the network.
- Russel mentioned that he is very interested in fulfilling niche GPU's as a provider. I have provided GPU's with similar requirements for Fluidstack.
- Max is working on wg-provider-attributes. Feel free to contribute in that channel. 




### Action Items

- Follow up on Provider issue with uptime and making sure stats reflect uptime when the provider is SUPPOSED to be on. 
- Anil will start to create a spec to think about Provider uptime. This will be brought up during the next Steering Committee meeting. 
- Anil to add his provider attributes doc to wg-provider-attributes discord channel.
