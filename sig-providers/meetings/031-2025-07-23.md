## **Transcript**

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to SIG providers. It is Wednesday, July 23rd, 2025. During the special interest group for providers, the group gets together together to talk about all things related to the Akash provider on the Akos network. again we historically have talked about the provider experience and we get updates from Jigger and Deval and all things relate to provider console previously we talk about just if there's any provider related upgrades on the horizon or any provider related issues any provider experience items or again anything that maybe is a bug or needs to be talked about that's in the support repo is tagged as provider.

Tyler Wright: So if anybody has anything specific that they want to make sure we cover during the agenda, feel free to drop in the chat and we'll make sure that we discuss it. otherwise I will hand it over to Jigger and Deval who again have actively been working on Prader since its inception I think a number of years ago at this point as a way to build and then manage providers and now have again brought that into the console experience. and are leading the efforts on the provider console. so I'll hand it over to them. Again, you can always track what's going on across the efforts on the GitHub. If you go to the Akos network GitHub, you can track items on the projects board here and just go to client product and engineering road map. And you can also look at specific items inside the console repo.

Tyler Wright: and there's a number of milestones there that you can track across again provider efforts and otherwise.  So without further ado, I'll hand it over to Jigger and Dval to talk about some of the updates and some of the things that are over the last month and some of the things coming up over next

Jigar Patel: Thanks T. so we have been working on provider console earnings API. so this is the starting of a series of APIs that we will publish in a future. the first one is the earnings API and our providers were asking this for a long time. So we have started working on that. we refreshed the work. we are actually right now on last stage of testing right now and we will push to production after hours today. So you will have access through the provider console.

Jigar Patel: So you go to provider console you create API key and then you will able to use the documentation the swagger documentation will be published as well and you'll able to see the documentation how to call the API and you will able to specify the time duration from you will able to get your earnings through that time in AKT USDC and total of both. yeah so that's a great news. we are pushing good day.

Jigar Patel: so you'll have access that and for the next step we are working we're going to start working on the provider notifications which lets the provider notify their users about any down times any maintenance or if it's going offline in im indefinitely and then provider holders of that providers  will able to see those notifications in their console. So That's the next AP that we are we're just going to link that AP here. and yeah and then general improvements into UIUX.

Jigar Patel: there are some bugs here and that is in the issues on the console repo. so we're going to start working on that as yeah, so that's the update from us. back to you Tyler.

Tyler Wright: Amazing. Thank you very much. Does anyone have any questions on anything that Jigger just talked about? All right. Again, look out for announcements in Discord and other channels if you have the ability.  and even if it doesn't affect you, I know a lot of the Akash insiders do a great job of being ambassadors in the Akash community and disseminating information. So if you see something or anybody has any questions, feel free to just continue to share some of these updates on the provider console side. and just look out for additional updates soon. Cool.


### 00:05:00

Tyler Wright: One thing I want to call out as it pertains to just a provider experience. I know that the core team is working on a number of efforts related to again the Cosmos SDK migration which we'll talk about in more detail during SIG chain. but I know a lot of the migration will include some provider testing. I see a mere potato on the call. right now there's doing a test environment is being built. There's going to be a number of days of internal testing that are done.

Tyler Wright: but as the core team has done with a number of previous kind of test net environments there's going to be a need and opportunity for a number of people from the community to contribute to testing basic functionality across just simple node functionality and then pretty soon there will be some provider updates made and folks will have to help test out that kind of stuff.  I think Scott who's on the call has historically just had people go through documentation, but I'm sure there's a checklist that we want to get more people from the community involved again as we get ready for the consk migration which will be happening in the next couple of months.

Tyler Wright: So there'll be some provider related items there. But even prior to that and I'm talking about it because it's on this ape page right now here that Jigger just shared. right now there is one last item around JWT and the provider part of the JWT experience that's being tested internally by the core engineering team.  Prior to the network upgrade, all providers will have to upgrade to be able to implement JWT because this is something that again we've talked about this in great detail at SIG Chain. will make network upgrades and other parts of the experience a lot more secure and a lot better for active clients on the network.

Tyler Wright: so there may be some testing that will be involved there and then again there will be a subsequent provider release that will be out that other people that all people will have to upgrade to that will implement JWT on providers. So there will be further announcements and documentation. I'm sure provider console will have a way to upgrade via the provider console. So please look out for those announcements that'll be happening very soon.  Again, this JWT implementation on all providers will have to happen before the next network upgrade. So, I just want to make people aware of that. Zeke, Scott, correct me if I've said anything out of turn or incorrectly.

Scott Carruthers: Yeah. No, I think that's all accurate. So, the introduction of GWT, one of the primary driver behind it is be able to query workloads while the network is down. So, yeah, JWT will definitely be high vetted and in place before the network upgrade. yeah, I think you said everything correctly.  Happens every once in a

Tyler Wright: Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Even a broken clock or whatever the expression is. any other questions about again anything provider console related or anything related to JWT and the provider release that'll be coming up shortly. All right.  I did want to see if there's any other provider related topics that anybody wanted to make sure that we discussed here today live. All right, I'm going to quickly take a look in the providers channel again.

Tyler Wright: shout out to Akos Vanguards, Akos insiders, members of the core team for trying to stay as diligent as possible inside Discord. Obviously, Discord is the builder channel where a lot of folks ask questions. I know the provider channel and provider bills channel are quite active. if you have any questions about the provider console, there's a provider console support channel in there as so again please please if you have any questions them in Any feedback drop them in there or the SIG providers channel between meetings. there's a number of issues that are being either worked on or talked about by core team members of the community and SIG commu or SIG support and other channels. So again there might be some provider related issues or things being worked on.


### 00:10:00

Tyler Wright: I know that members of the core team are working on I think ARM 64 building Linux provider. So I know there's a number of efforts that are going on and being tested. I'm sure as time goes on. I would love for folks working on some of those projects. I know there's a kosh at home work that's going on. When it's more like refined, I would love to take some opportunity during these sync provider calls to talk about progress ideation, All If there's nothing else that anybody wants to talk about today, then we can certainly just drop off a little bit early. I know the sick providers meetings oftent times take up the full time. So again, please let me know if you need anything from me.

Tyler Wright: if you have any questions related to the provider experience, please drop a message in any of the provider channels inside Discord. and just tag appropriate people. again, there's a clear escalation path for anybody that has issues in the community. And if you want to get more involved, again, please ask questions to air potato who leads the contributions program. look at the support repo, see if there's something that you feel like you can tackle or want to get more involved with and then again air potato myself, Adam Wy, or others can help facilitate, making sure you're in the right place to kind of contribute. So yeah, if there's nothing else then again, I hope everyone has a great rest of their day. Please let me know if there's anything you need, but again, thank you very much, Jigger and Dval, as always for the updates.

Tyler Wright: You can track all the updates across console in the milestones repo and I know that George will make sure that the milestones the road map 859 that Jigger put in chat will all be in the notes. So hope everyone has a great rest of your day. Thank you to those that are listening later. Enjoy your day.

Deval Patel: Thank you.

Tyler Wright: Enjoy your Wednesday everybody. Bye-bye.

Scott Carruthers: Thanks everyone.

Kenny R: Bye.
