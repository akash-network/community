## Meeting Notes

### Welcome and Opening Remarks
- **Tyler Wright** welcomed everyone to the SIG Support monthly meeting, emphasizing the importance of triaging issues in the support repository and addressing Akash Network issues on GitHub.
- Outlined the meetingâ€™s flow: triage support issues, address community concerns in Discord and Telegram, and conclude with open discussion.

### Triage of Support Repo Issues
- **Scott Carruthers** reviewed issues awaiting triage in the support repo, detailing each one:
  - **Pod Stability Issues**: Investigation ongoing to reduce out-of-memory (OOM) issues, particularly affecting GPU AI workloads. Core team is exploring the use of Kubernetes host swap files to alleviate these issues. Issue assigned a high priority (P1) and added to the engineering roadmap.
  - **Coinbase Transaction Error**: User mistakenly sent AKT to a Coinbase source address. Tyler is investigating ways to return the small amount of AKT involved and will handle the follow-up.
  - **Wallet Operation Error in Praetor App**: Jigar initially responded to clarify this user-reported error, which may stem from configuration issues. The team is awaiting further user input and feedback to investigate fully.
  - **Authorized Spend Without Expiration**: An edge case where deploying a spend without an expiration date produces erroneous date outputs. Issue noted as potentially display-only, needing further testing to confirm. Assigned for additional testing by Scott.
  - **Inconsistent Block Time Calculation**: Discrepancy found in average block time values between the Akash console and bid engine script, affecting deployment price estimates. Suggestion raised to use a shared value repository to avoid future inconsistencies. Scott will take this issue offline for further evaluation.

### Community Discussion on Discord and Telegram Behaviors
- **Tyler Wright** invited feedback on observed behaviors or themes in support-related channels:
- **Community Spam and Bot Activity**: No specific issues were raised during this meeting, though Tyler emphasized using the SIG Support channel to report any suspicious activity.

### Open Floor for Additional Issues
- Tyler opened the floor for further discussion on any issues, behaviors, or topics not covered in the formal agenda.
- No additional issues or behaviors were raised at this time.

### Closing Remarks
- Tyler thanked all participants, especially Scott, for leading the triage session, and expressed appreciation for community contributions in support channels.
- Encouraged attendees to stay engaged in Discord and GitHub to help monitor and report issues between meetings.

## Action Items
- **Scott Carruthers**: Investigate pod stability improvements using Kubernetes host swap files and continue testing the Authorized Spend Without Expiration edge case.
- **Tyler Wright**: Follow up on the Coinbase transaction error to return the small amount of AKT mistakenly sent by the user.
- **Scott Carruthers**: Resolve the block time calculation discrepancy by exploring a shared value repository for consistent pricing estimates across the console and bid engine script.
- **Core Team**: Coordinate testing for the Cosmos SDK v0.47 upgrade and reach out to community members experienced with validator setup for involvement in this testing group.
- **All Participants**: Use the SIG Support channel to report any spam, bot activity, or behavior issues observed in community channels (Discord, Telegram).
