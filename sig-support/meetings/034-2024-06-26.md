    - Gather feedback from Vanguard insiders and community members to improve support documentation and identify recurring themes.
    - Discussion on the restructure of the meeting.

- **Issue Triage:**
  - Scott Carruthers took over to triage issues.
  - Only one issue was awaiting triage:
    - **Issue:** Kubernetes concern for providers spawning too many processes within a container, affecting the host and potentially crashing it.
    - **Discussion:**
      - Scott asked if Andrey Arapov had seen the issue before.
      - Andrey confirmed it was the first time he saw the issue.
      - Scott provided a brief overview and suggested some testing to understand the problem better.
      - Andrey agreed to review and test the issue further.
      - The issue was assigned to Andrey for initial review and labeled as P2.

- **Feedback from Discord and Other Channels:**
  - Tyler Wright opened the discussion on feedback from active Discord members.
  - **Damir Simpovic:**
    - Mentioned an increase in new, unknown accounts asking directly for partnerships without proper introduction.
    - Suggested a filtering mechanism to avoid tagging core team members without proper context.
  - **Tyler Wright:**
    - Agreed with Damir and suggested training insiders and community members to ask follow-up questions to filter legitimate requests.
    - Highlighted the importance of understanding what the person is looking to do with the Akash Network before tagging core team members.
  - **Rodri R:**
    - Agreed with the need for a filtering mechanism.
    - Mentioned issues with bots starting conversations and sharing scam links.
  - **Scott Carruthers:**
    - Suggested creating a dedicated channel for new partnerships and integrations.
    - Emphasized the need for a structured approach to handle partnership requests.
  - **Tyler Wright:**
    - Proposed training insiders to ask specific questions to filter out non-serious requests.
    - Suggested using a standardized set of questions to streamline the process.

- **Discussion on Uptick in Activity:**
  - Tyler Wright asked if there was an uptick or downtick in provider activities and deployments within the ecosystem.
  - Requested continued monitoring of this trend to see if documentation improvements are reducing the number of questions or changing the types of questions being asked.

- **Meeting Restructure Proposal:**
  - Tyler Wright discussed a preliminary idea to combine the support and documentation meetings due to their overlap.
  - Proposed having a monthly SIG engineering core meeting focused on blockchain and technical issues, reducing the frequency of the SIG support meeting.
  - Emphasized the importance of triaging issues transparently to encourage community participation.
  - Acknowledged the learning curve for new contributors and suggested streamlining the process for more effective engagement.
  - Asked for initial thoughts, concerns, and feedback on the proposed restructure.

- **Sig Clients and Console 2.0:**
  - Tyler Wright mentioned discussions in the Sig clients meeting about Console 2.0 and its impact on the Praetor team.
  - Scott Carruthers has been refining provider build upgrade paths with ongoing internal discussions and community feedback.
  - Testing remains a key next step for finalizing these upgrades.

- **Upcoming Meetings and Working Groups:**
  - Tyler reminded attendees of several upcoming meetings:
    - Sig Providers meeting in 29 minutes.
    - Akash website and documentation working group meeting tomorrow.
    - Steering committee meeting tomorrow afternoon.

- **Documentation and Sig Website Meeting:**
  - Scott Carruthers raised concerns about the overlap and relevance of documentation discussions within the Sig website meeting.
  - Tyler clarified the hierarchical process for merging documentation items, which involves checks from Scott or Andrey.
  - There is no expectation for Scott or Andrey to join every Sig website meeting unless there is a specific agenda item relevant to documentation.
  - Tyler emphasized efficient use of core team members' time, ensuring agenda items relevant to them are prioritized.

**Clarifications:**
- **Participation in Sig Website Meeting:**
  - Scott and Andrey are not required to join every Sig website meeting.
  - They will join only if there is a specific documentation-related agenda item.
  - Tyler will ensure relevant items are scheduled early in the agenda to optimize time management.


- **Handling Documentation Updates:**
  - Scott Carruthers raised a concern about managing documentation updates, especially when the core team is busy.
  - Tyler Wright suggested that if a core team member has the time and willingness, they should handle the updates directly for efficiency.
  - If the core team is unable to handle it, creating an issue in the appropriate channel is recommended, allowing community members to pick it up.
  - There is a need to ensure community contributions are encouraged without overburdening the core team.

- **Engaging the Community:**
  - Tyler emphasized the importance of community contributions to manage the workload.
  - If core team members are too busy, they should still ensure issues are created for community tracking.
  - Tyler acknowledged Hero's proactive contributions and encouraged others to follow suit.
  - Scott agreed but expressed slight concern over issues potentially falling through the cracks if neither the core team nor the community takes immediate action.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Tyler proposed discussing this further in the working group for the website and documentation meeting tomorrow.
  - Emphasized the importance of creating issues for tracking any undocumented discussions or updates in the Insiders chat.
**Closing Remarks:**
- Tyler thanked everyone for their time and contributions, emphasizing the importance of efficient collaboration between the core team and the community.

## Action Items
- Tyler Wright to add the restructure of the meeting format to the next meeting's agenda.
- Tyler to follow up on creating a standardized set of questions for insiders to use when handling partnership requests.
- Damir Simpovic and Rodri to monitor Discord for partnership requests and apply the filtering mechanism by asking follow-up questions.
