# Notes

- Artur walked throught the support repo from the last two weeks.
- It was quiet in terms of new issues in the support Repo.
- For issue #73 , the naming has been updated to proper release v.24. Artur wants to match network upgrade to software version. Only the name has changed. 
- Artur would like some help in testing the upgrade. Artur will focus on the environment setup ASAP, and will hope to set up testing by next sig-support meeting.
- [Issue #23](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/23) was popping up in the past a few times. Artur pulled a few updates into the Ledger. A user was able to test this issue. This should be resolved. 
- Migration to the CometBFT is done.
- Artur still owes the environment setup. Hope to have this done by next support meeting.
- Pablo asked if there is a debugger that can be added to an environment. Pablo suggests adding this "how to" in the documentation.
- Pablo has been working on understanding the Provider codebase. Pablo has a solution on where to put the public IP. 
- Pablo's question is around the delay with IP operator. 
- Artur mentioned that it does take a couple of seconds to get to IP Operator. The lease may be open by the time. IP operator creates a CRD for every lease. This could be a way to get the IP address.
- Artur is looking to see if IP Operator can connect with IP client. This is the preferred approach.
- Artur mentioned the Pod may be shutdown when services are added. 
- Andrey suggested "k8s's configmap injection"
- Artur asked Pablo if he can research how to add a pod variable without restarting the pod. This is the first thing that needs to be solved. 
- Pablo suggests a small container inside of the pod, as a microservice.
- Andrey mentioned mounting variables to a POD.
- Andrey will work on issue #80. This is low priority.
- Andrey is working on issue #31. This is a governance parameter. Andrey will test on 
- Andrey talked about issue #49. Andrey wants a push button solution to test new version of network and statesync.
- Artur mentioned there are few challenges with this. Cosmos SDK had some issues testing statesync. Akash needs to incorporate the scripts from Osmosis team. Statesync is very sensitive. 
- Artur would like to github action within Node repo. This action should be triggered manually. There should be a matrix of states to test statesync on. 
- Artur wants the solution to be used for network upgrade. 
- Scott mentioned that it has been quiet across discord. 
- There were a lot of inquiries around providers over the past couple of months, but those questions have slowed down.
- Insiders are helping getting new users test AKT. This replaces the faucet.
- Scott mentioned the future being around the Sandbox test environment. 
- Scott mentioned Andrey and Damir were working on an issue around crashing provider pods. This have been solved. He was using old versions of Helm.
- Insiders continue to step up to handle all forms of support. 
- Rodri agreed with Scott.
