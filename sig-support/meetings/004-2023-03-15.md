# Notes

- Artur walked throught the support repo from the last two weeks.
- Artur shared feedback about issue #22. Nothing that can be done about this right now.
- Artur talked about Issue #81. Artur is resisting bringing in 3rd party tools. Support is a big issue or updates will be a challenge? Artur asked who would maintain it?
- Artur mentioned that development documents should be done by this week, and then the group can discuss it.
- Once docs are published, issue #81 may not be needed. This issue is labeled "needs-verification".
- Artur removed the tag "kind-needs-verification'.
- Some issues are marked for Andrey, and he is not available. 
- Artur talked about issue #34 about documenting MTLS proxy.
- Anil asked if Scott was working on MTLS documentation. Scott is not working on it currently. 
- Artur discussed issue #82. The message is a little bit cumbersome right now. This is a "sev2" issue.
- Artur discussed issue #62. This issue needs to be validated. It will be added to the network upgrade v 0.22.
- Artur talked about issue #70. This issue was assigned to Scott. Anil marked this issue "P2".
- Issue #24 is an issue that is low priority. Artur will find the fix. This is "sev2". 
- In regards to issue #22, Artur does not think it is a cert issue. This is a good example of needing template, because more information is needed to diagnose the problem.
- Artur added a comment to issue #22 asking for for information. 
- Artur talked about issue #44. This is a good idea, but low priority so it is marked "P2".

- Scott and Artur are working on documentation which is outdated. This should be done by the end of the week. 
- It is in the provider, even though it works with Provider and Node. Config documentation should be kept in provider. 
- Overclock Labs cannot maintain Tilt. Pablo mentioned that the issue can be closed.

- Pablo is interested in taking on the issue that Anil will create.

- Anil talked about issues that are in the console report. There have already been contribution from the community.
