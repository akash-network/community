## Meeting Notes
### Post Mainnet Six Upgrade Issues and Fixes:
#### Artur Troian
- Artur provided updates on ongoing activities related to the post-mainnet six upgrade.
- Mentioned that two issues would be fixed during the upcoming software upgrade:
- Validators Commission Issue:
  - Explained that in the previous network upgrade, the validator's commission was set to 5% in the dryer mode but wasn't applied.
  - Assured that this issue would be addressed in the upcoming upgrade.
- Deployment Authorization Issue:
  - Described a problem where some deployment authorizations were connected to old API versions, causing discrepancies in querying and updating them.
  - Assured that this issue would also be fixed during the upgrade, with the resolution expected in a few hours.
- Refactoring Provider Behavior:
  - Highlighted a significant issue related to the upgrade involving the behavior of the provider.
  - Explained that the provider, in its current design, kills everything right into the lease if anything goes wrong during the deployment phase.
  - Acknowledged that this behavior is not correct and mentioned the decision to refactor it.
  - Discussed the introduction of a new operator called "deploy" to apply manifests fast and separately handle deployment failures.
  - Indicated the creation of a separate service to manage deployment after a specified timeout.
   
### Support Ticket Updates:
- Artur provided updates on several support tickets related to deployment accessibility and provider audits.
- Andrey shared that for one particular tickets the deployment appear to be down and mentioned ongoing testing for stable diffusion.
- Andrey  noted two more tickets for provider audits, one waiting for the enabling of firewall rules.
- Artur emphasized the need for labeling on the issues and suggested that they be labeled as "audits."
- Arthur Requested that the titles of all issues in the support repo follow a consistent format for easier identification and automation.
- Recommended that the titles include a keyword like "compliant" for auto-labeling purposes.
- Tyler Wright sought an example title from Artur for clarification on the desired structure.
- Tyler offered to update documentation to guide users in providing titles that align with the desired format.

### Scheduled Software Upgrade
#### Tyler Wright:
- Tyler  provided a quick update on the upcoming software upgrade.
- Mentioned that a proposal passed yesterday afternoon to address issues from the mainnet six upgrade, as discussed by Arthur.
- The software upgrade is scheduled for today around 9 am Pacific/12 pm Eastern time, approximately two hours from the current time.
- Emphasized that the upgrade will only impact validators.
- Urged communication among validators on the validators discord channel for any questions or concerns.
- Specifically directed participants to check the announcements channel in the validators discord for documentation related to the upgrade.
- Noted that Andy and others are actively available to answer any questions from validators.

### Support Update from Scott Carruthers:
- Tyler handed over the floor to Scott Carruthers to provide an update on support-related activities.
- Scott mentioned the presence of Rodri, Shimpa, and Max, inviting them and others to share insights on support activities over the past weeks.
- Scott informed about the upcoming announcement in the Providers Announcement channel regarding the consolidation of provider documentation to avoid redundancy.
- Described the consolidation process, making GPU resource enablement on a host provider similar to handling persistent storage or IP leases.
- Emphasized that the GPU provider build documentation will be removed, and all information will be consolidated into a single process for clarity.
- Mentioned testing the new process with a mainnet test provider, ensuring it worked flawlessly.
- Requested feedback from individuals like Shimpa, Rodri, and Max regarding the new documentation.
- Mentioned that Rodri and Damir, as front lines of support in the insider community, might have additional issues to raise.
- Noted that the majority of support over the last few weeks has involved assisting new GPU providers as they come online.
- Acknowledged that, fortunately, the process for GPU providers to build through documentation has been relatively smooth.
- Highlighted the support provided for live GPUs, particularly addressing SDL questions.
- Stated that, aside from GPU-related support, the overall network seems steady, with some new user questions being addressed.

### Damir Simpovic' Update on Support:
- Damir Simpovic shared insights on support issues, primarily addressing potential providers.
- Noted that some providers, particularly ex-miners, were not fully aware of Akash and thought they could shift their hardware seamlessly.
- Highlighted the misconception that Akash supports typical mainboards with limited memory and weak CPUs, making it challenging for these providers.
- Emphasized the need for clarification and education for such individuals
- Scott Carruthers acknowledged Damir's input and confirmed understanding of the issue.
- Recognized the challenges, especially for individuals with inappropriate hardware, even if the resources were otherwise suitable.

### Discussion on Provider Attributes and YAML File:
- Max raised a concern about attributes in the provider YAML file not being in sync with the schema, causing them to be overwritten during upgrades.
- Mentioned that the attributes in the provider YAML file sometimes do not match the schema when providers update.
- Scott acknowledged the issue Max brought up and understood the problem.
- Scott explained that during a fresh Helm upgrade, the provider YAML attributes take precedence and overwrite existing ones.
- Scott Agreed that there needs to be a discussion on how to address this issue, ensuring that the schema from Cloudmos aligns with the provider YAML file.
- Scott noted the need for a conversation with Max and Andy to find the best way to deal with the problem.

### Other Matters Discussed 
#### Community Input on SDL Improvement:
- Max mentioned plans to work on improving the SDL builder and experimenting with simplified forms to make SDL creation more accessible, especially for new users.
- Acknowledged the complexity of the current SDL and the challenge it poses for users to learn a new YAML schema.
- Max expressed the intention to gather feedback from the community based on the updates to the SDL builder. 
- Tyler appreciated Max's initiative and confirmed plans to distribute a form to collect feedback, discussing it further during the SIG Providers meeting.
- Mentioned that the collected information would be made available for use by Cloudmos and others interested in the data.
#### Announcements
- Tyler highlighted a SIG Providers meeting scheduled in 30 minutes, where updates from the praetor team's work and discussions on content moderation would take place.
- Mentioned that the praetor team is implementing solutions from the Content Moderation Working Group and encouraged community participation.
- Noted the positive reception of the provider attributes tooling from the cloudmos team and mentioned its implementation discussion in the last SIG Providers meeting.
- Announced a potential conversation during SIG Providers and the steering committee meeting about changes to the structure of the SDL.
- Requested community members actively using the Akash network to share their feedback on what is suboptimal about the SDL experience.
- Tyler will initiate the conversation during the SIG Providers meeting and possibly provide a type form for community input.
- Tyler encouraged participants to think about SDL-related challenges and share their thoughts during the SIG Providers call or through the type form.

## Action Item
- Group await the upcoming fix for the provider behavior issue.
- Group to ensure that all support issues are labeled appropriately.
- Group to address and fix the validators commission issue and deployment authorization issue during the upcoming upgrade.
- Scott Carruthers to initiate a discussion with Max and Andy to explore solutions for the synchronization issue between provider YAML attributes and the cloudmos schema during upgrades.
- Tyler Wright to distribute a form to gather feedback on SDL improvement.
