### Support 

- Rodri mentioned that there was nothing new on the support front. Things are steady.
- Benjamin noticed that there is an increase in spam and malicious messages on discord. Scammers have also changed their behavior to better avoid being banned. Efforts will be taken by the core team to help filter out spammers and scammers.
- Tyler asked that if anyone had any technical questions, or needed a technical demo from the core team, please feel free to reach out, so we can set it up for a future sig-support biweekly meeting.
