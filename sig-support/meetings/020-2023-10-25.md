- Andrey asked will we name the provider-services version in similar way as the network? Artur mentioned that provider services naming will be complely different.
- Artur talked about issue 137. This is a known issue, and this may be a duplicate. The feature discovery tool may help with this.
- Artur talked about issue 135. This is something that needs to be looked into. This is marked as P2.
