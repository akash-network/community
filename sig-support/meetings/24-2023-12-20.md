## Meeting Notes
#### Tyler Wright
- Mention of bounties available for those contributing to solving issues in the support repo.
- Discussed desire for increased community contributions on open support issues in 2024.
- Biweekly meetings will continue, providing an opportunity for participants to ask questions to the core team and refer to Scott's engineering notes for deeper understanding.
- Participants urged to review Scott's engineering notes for a better understanding of Akash Network's technical aspects.
- Recognition of Scott Carruthers' work on testing, especially for those building on top or setting up their environments.
- Anticipation of increased testing opportunities in early 2024 for local environment setup, simulating core team work.
- Confirmation of three planned network upgrades in the first quarter of 2024.
- Mention of action items related to labeling in the support repo.
- Reminder of further investigation needed for issue #156, to be discussed in the January 10th meeting.

### Issues Triage Session
- Andrey Arapov explains the [issue #166](https://github.com/akash-network/support/issues/166) related to Wild Card use and GPU models in bid prices.
- Issue arises from bid price script selecting the highest value without knowing GPU availability on the cluster.
- Andrey proposes a solution involving Akash provider recognizing the scheduler's deployment allocation for unspecified GPUs.
- Scott Carruthers assigns the issue to Arthur for further review and possibly assigns subtasks to Andrey.
- Discusses the second unassigned issue created by Arthur related to migrating client go code away from the node repository, planning for work in 2024.
- Mentions a third simple issue about HTTP options in go code with a proposal to change from uint32 to uint64.
- Decision to assign the second issue (client go code migration) to Arthur for clarity
#### GPU Reporting, Issue #137
- Max raises a concern about a GPU reporting issue causing a crash when indexing providers and their resources.
- Scott acknowledges the existence of an issue related to wrong GPU reporting with an extremely high value.
- Andrey Arapov provides details on how the issue can be reproduced by restarting the device plugin and suggests a potential solution involving a simple check in the Akash provider to handle wrong or incomplete information.
- Confirmation from Andrey Arapov that the count returns to normal after a while.
- Andrey Arapov suggests testing scenarios with multiple worker nodes, some with GPUs and some without, to observe how the device plugin handles this configuration.
- Scott Carruthers recalls past testing scenarios and agrees to revisit and conduct further testing to understand how the device plugin operates in different node configurations.

### Support 
- Tyler Wright emphasizes the importance of the Discord channel for technical conversations and support within the community.
- Acknowledges the efforts of insiders and vanguards who make themselves available 24/7 for user queries.
- Tyler Wright gives a shout-out to Max for his responsiveness in addressing Cloudmos-related issues and encourages users to post such issues in the Cloudmos repo.

#### Other matters discuused
##### Kernel Version Issue in Providers
- Andrey Arapov shares information about a potential issue related to providers losing leases, pods terminating, and worker nodes falling off.
- Mentions that the issue may be caused by running a newer kernel (above 5.15 ) on the host, leading to CPU performance problems.
- Recommends downgrading the kernel to 5.15 or adjusting liveness probe timings as workarounds.
- Highlights the importance of not over-provisioning resources and suggests managing resources dynamically.
- Tyler Wright expresses gratitude for the information and suggests posting a written format or announcement in the providers' announcements channel.
### Action Items
- Further investigation of issue #156 to be discussed in the January 10th meeting.
- Group to do more investigation to understand the persistence of the high count in GPU reporting, Issue #137.
- Andrey Arapov to create a written document or announcement regarding the kernel version issue and share it in the providers announcements channel.
