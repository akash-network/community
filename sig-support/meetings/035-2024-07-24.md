## Meeting Notes
**Welcome and Introduction**
- **Speaker: Tyler Wright**
- Overview of SIG Support biweekly meetings led by core engineering team members from Overclock Labs, focusing on Akash Network issues.
- Main topics: Issues in support repo (core product) and console repo (open source console).

**Change in Meeting Cadence**
- **Speaker: Tyler Wright**
- Proposal to change meeting frequency from biweekly to monthly.
- Focus less on issue triaging and more on general support in Discord, Telegram, and other channels.

- Consensus reached to change meeting frequency to monthly.

**Issue Triage and Discussion**
- **Speaker: Scott Carruthers**

- Identified only two issues awaiting triage.

**Discussion on Inventory Operator Issue**
- **Speaker: Scott Carruthers**
- Detailed analysis of an issue related to the inventory operator when pod names exceed 63 characters.
- Found that while the DNS limitation was acknowledged, the issue did not break the inventory operator in testing.
- Suggested potential solutions: updating documentation to recommend shorter hostnames or adjusting the pod naming convention to reduce character count.
- Andrey Arapov questioned whether it was a real bug or just a cosmetic issue, agreeing to verify with the user.
- Action assigned to Scott Carruthers for further validation and user follow-up.

**Discussion on Exposed Ports Issue**
