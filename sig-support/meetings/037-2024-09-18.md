### Opening Remarks
- **Tyler Wright** welcomed attendees to the Support Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting focused on Akash network support issues.
- Mentioned open invitation for any additional agenda items from participants, with a special focus on support and community interactions on Discord and other channels.

### Triage and Discussion on Akash Network Issues
- **Scott Carruthers** presented a screen share, beginning with triaging current issues in the Akash Network support repository:
  - **Internal Tracking Item:** Assigned to **Andy and Devolve** from the core team. Label updated for internal logging investigation; clarified it’s focused on internal workloads and Akash console.
  - **Shell Access Issue:** Resolved the shell access issue related to the provider pod restart. Updated labels and clarified it doesn’t resolve the issue of lease events dropping over time, which needs further investigation.
  - **UDP Protocol Misconception:** Issue raised by **Zeke** on UDP support availability for Akash deployments. After testing, it was confirmed that UDP is supported alongside TCP. Specific issue found with using the same port for both protocols in game server deployments, which requires further work on Kubernetes to support named field differentiation.

### Console Issues Update
- **Tyler Wright** inquired if there were any significant console-related issues that needed discussion.
  - **Maxime Beauchamp** mentioned minor issues but none urgent for the current meeting.
  - **Andrew Mello** raised a discrepancy in the bit engine script’s calculations on Helm charts versus the Akash console, which affects deployment CLI versus console.

### Discussion on Bugs and Upcoming Issues
- **Andrew Mello** introduced three critical bugs found during testing:
  - **Timeout Limit for Large Containers:** Five-minute timeout for deployment completion may not be sufficient for large containers (e.g., AI models), particularly on high-speed connections. Clarified it might not be a network parameter; **Scott** and others to investigate further.
  - **Control Plane Bidding Issue:** Control plane nodes are bidding when they shouldn’t, affecting deployment accuracy and network performance. Scott noted mechanisms to address node exclusion in inventory operators, but this needs further investigation.
  - **CPU Parameter Rollback:** Observed rollback from **512 CPUs** to **384 CPUs**, possibly unintentional. Andrew plans to create an issue to revert this limit back.

### Community and Discord Behavior Updates
- **Tyler Wright** opened the floor for community behavior issues, particularly around Discord spam and bot activity:
  - **Damir Simpovic** observed spam behavior involving bots posting links after conversational exchanges.
  - **Rodri R** reported recurring issues with new users creating spam-like chats, submitting tickets and support requests, and occasionally including screenshots.
  - **Tyler Wright** confirmed action items for refining the blacklist of restricted words and addressing spam through moderator tools and the Akash Insiders program.

**Closing Remarks:**
- **Tyler Wright** encouraged all participants to stay engaged in SIG activities, emphasizing collaboration through GitHub and Discord channels.
- Expressed gratitude for everyone’s contributions, especially in community support and repository management, and wished everyone a productive week.

## Action Items
- **Andrew Mello**: Create formal issues for the bugs discussed, including timeout limits, CPU parameter rollback, and control plane bidding issues.
- **Scott Carruthers**: Investigate the feasibility of updating the Akash network’s SDL to support simultaneous TCP and UDP on the same port.
- **Tyler Wright**: Review and update Discord’s blacklist and moderation settings, based on the observed issues and participant feedback.
- All participants were encouraged to submit any additional insights or issues in Discord channels and GitHub between meetings.
