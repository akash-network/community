All right, welcome everyone to our March. Working Groups call for events today. We are going to be talking about Akash Accelerate 2025 this year is going to be in Brooklyn, New York on the date of June 23 just the day prior to permissionless. So permissionless this year is going to be in Brooklyn as well. So we wanted to stay within the United States as consensus was actually going to be moved up to Toronto. We did it last year just prior to consensus. So due to that being out of the United States, we wanted to keep it somewhere local. And then we figured New York is a great hub. There are a lot of really great speakers and people who are always around in the city. So figured be the best opportunity for us to have our yearly second annual, which is so fun to say now, second annual Akash accelerate the Akash accelerate discussion is going up on GitHub this afternoon. I wanted to have this call first, and then we have the special interest group community call later. So after those and after the community gets chance to hear some things first, then we're going to put it on discussion today, and then let that run for about a week, and then hopefully put the GOV prop up in like a weeks so time. So that's going to be the main, I guess, timeline for the discussion. But I wanted to just quickly go through our agenda of what we plan on doing for Akash accelerate. I guess show of hands. Are any of you planning on coming? We are also this. I think Adam mentioned it yesterday. If you are interested in coming, please fill out the form stating that you want to come to Akash accelerate. We definitely have budget for five, maybe six insiders. So would love the help. Would love to be able to meet you in person and get to do some things that we I mean, like usually leading up to the event, we do, like some team bonding stuff and some dinners and all that sort of thing. So it would definitely be really fun to see you guys. So don't forget to sign up for that. I will throw that in the insiders channel on Discord so you can fill that out. But is anyone planning tentatively to come to accelerate? Maybe, I hope so, given that I know, I know it's a long like journey for people, especially if you have families and stuff. But do know that, like, if you are chosen, if you decide to come, you won't have to pay out of pocket. So that's something else that, like you know, you can consider should be really fun. We are planning on doing it at the location 74 wise. That's spelled W, i, t, h e, in Williamsburg, New York. Let me share my screen, actually, actually, no, I don't have that. Sorry. I'm not gonna do that right now. So it's right. It's like a half a block away from the water. So like from the rooftop you can see in overlook Manhattan, we got a really great price on it, virtually the same amount of money we spent last year for all of the venues, is what we're spending this year. We have more space, and it's a beautiful building that has outdoor and indoor capabilities. So we're gonna have a full day of content, pretty much, starting at 930 in the morning, going until 630 or, I'm sorry, going till five o'clock, and then after at five o'clock, we're planning on doing like a little social mixer on the rooftop. Hopefully the weather is great. We can have the retractable ceilings open, hoping for a great night. Good weather. Should be a lot of fun, but as of right now, we already have 23 guests who are who have, like, confirmed that they're going to come and speak. We're aiming to get 15 more. So we want to have around 35 speakers to come, inviting a bunch of media New York's a great hub for that. So we do have someone from the block already planning on coming and doing interviews, so that's exciting, yeah, and just we want to get like, different write ups in, like Bloomberg and like other things. That's like our goal. We want to have that be a bigger push this year than last year. So I think with with us being in New York City, that should be easy to accomplish. Cross my fingers. We are planning on doing two new T shirt merch designs. So right now, Dennis, our graphics designer, is working on some really awesome Brooklyn theme, the feel of like New York City. And so we're going to be doing 2t shirt designs and actually doing a pop up store. So that's something new. So at our location, we have a bunch of different rooms, so we're going to do a build out so it'll look like you're stepping into a New York City like merch pop up or a store. So everyone who comes in will be able to, like, quote, unquote, buy or just walk through and get some merchandise like you would walking into a pop up. So really excited about that. We're going to bring back all of the stamps that we worked or we did for each conference throughout last year, some new stamp designs our hoodies. So also, if you guys have some designs or anything that you'd love to see featured, I would love your opinions on that. Or if there's any ideas that you guys have that you would like to see, I know some of you may be tuning into the live stream. So that is another thing that we are definitely going to be doing again. Last year, Adam wasn't able to attend the cash accelerate because he just had his baby. So this year, or I'm sorry, so with that, Adam put together with the community, I think, four to five different watch parties that were all around the world that people tuned into and had, like, you know, food and, you know, we've paid for some of the things for those watch parties. So we're planning on doing that again. Hopefully we can have some more watch parties and pictures from that, from people tuning in. It's going to be live streamed. We're going to have a full AV team there that's going to be doing cuts of every like keynote and panels and all the content for the day. So as far as like, a full production, we're pretty much keeping it the same format loosely as what we did last year. As far as like, wanting to have quality speakers come and quality recordings and stuff, and then trying to think what else I can mention? I think that's pretty much it right now. Like I said, the GitHub or the GitHub discussion will go live this afternoon, so if you wanted to read a little bit more, you definitely can. Would love to hear some comments. But while I have you four on the call, is there anything that you guys would like to see implemented at Akash accelerate this year? I

Unknown Speaker  7:28  

nobody.

Rodri R  7:31  

No ideas right now, but I'll let you know if something comes up, probably going to be great. I remember those watch parties last year I hosted one of those, and if you're gonna be doing that again,

Amanda Keay  7:45  

I'll try to help out. Oh, great, yes, I don't

Rodri R  7:49  

think I can attend, like you said, family stuff and those things, but maybe next year. Yeah,

Amanda Keay  7:57  

that's a good goal. Yeah. That's really awesome. I'm glad the watch party went well for you. We definitely would love to see more of our community members doing that this year. I think there were over 2300 live stream views that day, so that's a pretty decent amount. I'm happy with that. Hopefully that number goes up this year and as well as attendees. So last year, our main venue was a little smaller for where content was going to be. Was being filmed. I think we only had like 35 seats, which sounds crazy. It almost made it very exclusive. So like, we shut the doors and people, like, if they wanted to go to that session, would come in and like, you know you had to be there first. So that created almost like a scarcity moment, like, if you wanted to see Eric Voorhees and Greg talk like you had to be in lines when the door opened, like you were there. This year, we have a lot more space, so we're going to be having on the rooftop seating for 200 guests at any given time seated. And then we're also going to have like loungers around and high tables. So we can probably get four Well, upstairs is 400 standing. So definitely way more room, lots of different space and places for people to work and do fun things throughout the day. So hey, Zeke, how's it going? Good, good. I was just kind of running through this meeting is kind of a cost accelerate focused. So it was just going through last year versus this year. This year is obviously going to be at a bigger place in New York or in Williamsburg. So almost 400 500 person standing capacity. So we're hoping to really, I mean, last year, we had just under 400 attendees. I'm hoping to increase that number significantly. I think it's, I think it's definitely possible. So we're going to be rolling out marketing materials and. And stuff on Twitter in the next two weeks. So we will definitely keep you guys updated. Yeah, ship, is

Damir Simpovic  10:10  

that on in that the that place? Arlo. Arlo,

Amanda Keay  10:15  

that no, so actually it's next door to the Arlo,

Damir Simpovic  10:20  

okay, all right, yeah, because I remember it was really good, cool, yeah,

Amanda Keay  10:26  

yeah. So it's, it's actually right next door, called 74 wise. Let me see if I can pull up a picture, if my internet,

Unknown Speaker  10:37  

my goodness,

Amanda Keay  10:40  

but yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a really nice, I would say, rectangle building two stories. There's a downstairs area that we're going to have, like the merch store pop up. There's going to be, like a bar that's going to be serving food and drinks all day, as well as a mezzanine area. So the plan is to have a couple different people coming in. Last year, we did a tattoo artist. This year, we might be bringing a tattoo artist back, maybe. And I'm thinking about doing like a custom jewelry exhibit to where, like a little shout out to the females. Females attend conferences too. So I'm trying to work on like a custom, like Akash gold emblem or something like a charm, almost. And then we'll have, like, a jewelry, someone who's going to come and, like, do soldering on, like bracelets and anklets and rings and stuff. So just something cute, fun people can, like, tune into if they want to get a tattoo. We definitely want to bring that back. And then upstairs, like I mentioned, it's a beautiful rooftop all glass. The sliding the sides of it actually open up as well as the roof. So am I getting a tattoo? Fuck now, excuse me,

Rodri R  11:53  

you should get some of those, the hair thingies, scrunchies, or something like that, with your cash logo. Maybe

Amanda Keay  12:00  

that's a good idea. Like a little scrunchie. I like that. I thought about also doing like, some sort of like clips with our like, I don't know, some females are into clips, and could be too. I thought about nails, potentially, like a nail artist to come and do like, you know, a little logo or something. I don't know. Still, a little bit of those things are like up in the air. Those are like more of the finer details, but like the main venues solid. Let me share my screen now that my internet is working. Okay. So present. Okay. So this is the space, alright. So that's the view from the upstairs area. This is the building, so like down here in this area, we're going to change out these lights, I think, to be like somewhat red. We're going to like on the street. This is facing the street. We're going to have a big red carpet and a bunch of branding here above the doors. And then you can kind of see up here in this area. This is all the upstairs with the glass. So all of our branding will be able to be seen from the street as well, which is also important. And then I have a very fun oops. Hold on. I see more pictures of this.

Unknown Speaker  13:37  

Yeah, let's do the roof.

Unknown Speaker  13:39  

That's the most beautiful part of it.

Amanda Keay  13:46  

My god, okay, yeah, so this is an example of like a party, but this is what the potential space could look like. So we have a lot of lot of greenery, a lot of open someone brought in a pickleball court, but we can pretty much make this space our own, and that's what we're going to do, lots of branding. It's very light and airy. And then at night, we're going to, hopefully, if the weather's good, we're going to open up, stop presenting, open up the ceiling, and then it can be almost like a nighttime, super fun event open aired. So that's the goal. We do also, I guess I can share this with you guys, since you're on the working group call, we're planning on having a big Akash hot air balloon at the event as well. So that's going to be on the rooftop, and people be able to see it technically from Manhattan, but you'll also be able to see it from the road, and it'll be a great photo op area. As far as, like, being in the clouds with a caution sort of thing. So that'll also be a really fun branding opportunity for people. I don't think I have anything else to share. As far as. Updates yet. I mean, like I said, the GitHub discussion will go live today, so if you have any thoughts or anything, please also drop them there. I'll be definitely tuned into that discussion. Yeah, Roger,

Rodri R  15:17  

yeah. The little love topic, I know you're super busy with cash accelerate. But any info on Cosmo work? Cosmo burst.

Unknown Speaker  15:27  

So other than we were saying,

Rodri R  15:28  

they announced the place, and probably Akash will be making a presence, I don't even know the date. So,

Amanda Keay  15:38  

yes, I I'm not sure. I don't remember the dates off the top of my hand. I do know that it's in quarter three. So right now, we finalized all of the quarter two events, but it's definitely on our list. I know it's in Croatia this year. The pricing looks good. I mean, the hotels for people traveling like it's very cheap and affordable, which I know, compared to, like Dubai last year that was a big issue for people traveling. So at least it with, with it being close to, I mean, within Europe, I think that more people are going to attend, and then they can come and stay for, like, I think it was like 100 bucks a night, or something like that. So that's very, very affordable. I have not talked with the broader team yet about what we plan on doing there, or, like, I know it's on the list of of things to do, but yeah, I don't have any update on that yet.

Rodri R  16:33  

Sorry, no, yeah, no problem. I I imagine you're busy with other stuff. Now, I thought maybe because it was in the summer too. So, no, I think the third quarter. So they're still, yeah,

Amanda Keay  16:47  

I think it's the third quarter. I want to say it's October sometime, but don't quote me. I can try to get an answer

Unknown Speaker  16:53  

for you, though. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  16:58  

late October. Okay, yeah,

Damir Simpovic  17:01  

if you don't, if you don't go, you're not allowed to show your face, any, any, any, anymore, exactly. You have to come because that's, yeah, that's like my right next door.

Amanda Keay  17:17  

I know you're going to be right there. You can run, some parties for us,

Damir Simpovic  17:26  

tours. I can do all sorts of stuff. And it's worth it. It's worth it. It's cheap, and it's worth it,

Amanda Keay  17:33  

okay? I mean, I've always, I've seen beautiful pictures of like, Croatian waterfalls and, yeah, I mean, would love to attend, what

Damir Simpovic  17:43  

is the city? So this is the city, yeah, there won't be waterfalls, exactly. But, I mean, if you don't mind, you know, spending an hour or so in a car, you could go and see some, you know, super crazy, beautiful scenery, or take a boat to a nearby island. Or, yeah, yeah. But spirit is the, yeah, it's a really big city on the coast. Very old, very, very old. So, yeah, there's stuff to do there. Okay, awesome.

Amanda Keay  18:24  

Looking forward to it. Yeah, we I just leading. I mean, like, obviously I'm taking events as they come. I are, I am thinking about quarter three, but have not yet had a discussion with the team about that yet. But, I mean, we went last year and we had a really good time. There weren't as many. I think due to, like, the fact that it was Dubai, it was really far for a lot of people, it was expensive. Like, a lot of people didn't end up going, like, community. People that normally do go, like, when we had it in Columbia, or when there was it was in Istanbul. So I'm hoping that this year we get more of the sponsors and more of the layer ones to come out, because last year was just like, a little bit under attended in that regards. And then also, like, more of the community, like, if someone's, you know, if you can come for cheaper, I think that's definitely going to be an option or better for for people in attendance. And also, I think they're reworking the way they're doing it, like last year they had hack most, which is, like, their hackathon. It was after the event, so, like, it was kind of split. I think this year they're planning on having it all during the same four days. So they're not people aren't having to, like, choose which one they want to go to. Yeah, and you're right. The macro sentiment was probably worse last year, although our side event, we had the big penthouse party right next door, it was maxed out. It was the biggest event there. So as far as, like, Akash, we got that. But, yeah, I don't think I have any more updates specific. Typically tied to a cost accelerate. But if any of you have questions or suggestions of things that you'd love to see, or any like small activations, small or big whatever, don't be afraid to drop it, drop me a message or comment in the discussion. Would love to get your thoughts. But if no one does, I will end this a little bit early and look forward to putting that discussion up on chain later this afternoon. And I hope to see all of you, or some of you, please sign up if you can to come to Akash, accelerate right now, only two people from the community signed up as wanting to come. And I know it's the summer, I know it's might be far, but if you can try to make it, it would be a really great time, especially to meet everyone. And the whole core team will be there, so we're bringing out everybody like we did last year. So it's going to be a really fun time in Brooklyn, so I will let you guys all have the rest of your days back to you, and I'll probably see you at the insider's community call and the community call later as well. Have a nice day, everyone. Thanks for popping in. Thank you. See you later. Yep, I see you every morning. You.
