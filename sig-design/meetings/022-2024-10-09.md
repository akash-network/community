### Swag Shop and Merchandise

- Next working group meeting is scheduled for next week to continue alignment on YouTube content and design.

- Design Submissions Scope: Discussion on design concepts, with Denis clarifying that designs should remain relevant to Akash's brand. Robert explained the broader range for Zealy submissions (e.g., hats, notepads, USBs) but noted that unrelated submissions, like home decor, may not be suitable.

### Closing Remarks
- Denis shared a link to Akash’s brand guidelines for those interested in creating designs aligned with the brand.

# **Transcript**

Denis Lelic: Hey everybody and welcome to today's sick design meeting. I see Daniel and David, I'm not sure if you guys are here for the first time, so just a short intro. And for others, as well, that might be listening to this recording, sick design, meets monthly to discuss all things design related. So, we're covering from branding merchandise, video website, product design. And if necessary we are forming working groups to focus on specific projects. So yeah.

Denis Lelic: So basically, during these meetings, we reviewed you, what was accomplish in the past month, and share some plans, maybe for the month I had. So as probably everyone's aware September is always packed with events. So some community members and core team were attending Korean Blockchain, weak Token, 249 and I think it happened. Last week and we have permissionless now as we speak. So for each of these events we've designed and produced lots of new materials. From both designs merchandise, giveaways, presentation's, and so on and so on. So

Denis Lelic: And this month as well, it's just as busy with cosmovers and neural iPS coming in. And of course, permissions as I said is happening as we speak.

Denis Lelic: Maybe the next topic. A website just from a high level website. Also has a working groups. It's called Working Group, a college website and that group, we're always working to improve the user experience at a new content. Maybe redesigning some of the parts to make the user experience better smoother and So if you guys visited network recently, you'll notice some changes around the menu. So that's a new redesign experience where I believe we solve a couple of issues that were occurring to many users. And now,

Denis Lelic: Some of the content is easier to find and it's basically resurfacing and we see other issues arising. So because people are aware of these pages now and then what I improve them so in the next week or so I'm just gonna create a bunch of new issues to update those pages redesign them maybe but yeah, plenty of work there in the working group for the website. So, yeah, maybe you've noticed a design direction. On the website. We have this new serif font, we've been using.

Denis Lelic: Partially in some of the presentation and social media posts and in the events. So, we're Kind of decided to include that serif font and the website as well, and it's becoming this part of the brand Akash as a brand. And next to that there's a new fresh set of illustrations. So now we're gonna make sure to update this brand direction, across all this different touch points. We're having so from events and merge social media videos and so on and so on. And Get us started our work on updating the brand manual and sharing that in different channels and making sure there is the right package to download on the website as well.

Denis Lelic: Maybe. Another thought, topic around the website.

Denis Lelic: It's always on the list, So it's the Swag shop with planning to redesign it and add New items. There, I like to see that move into production as soon as possible, but I'm sure everyone is aware of. We are not in the business of creating commerce and swag. So it's kind of always there on the list, but we got other things to do. But yeah, personally, would love to see Dad move into production soon.


### 00:05:00

Denis Lelic: so, I'm just gonna keep it very high level. there's a number of other design projects in the progress, especially around a cash console, which we'll see new experiences rolling out soon. However, I'm glad Robert is here, so maybe he can just share some of the updates From the working groups of Akash YouTube Channel and Zealy. So, maybe Robert you can just start off with YouTube, sharing the updates progress, any blockers. So, anything you feel is worth sharing. So, the stage is yours.

Robert Del Rey: Absolutely. Thanks Yeah, about due to We had our last working group call a little over a week ago. it last week was quick in a day ago. And yeah, the biggest of the updates was that all the steering committee calls are uploaded with the thumbnail. We designed. Thanks BS. The item that I'm waiting.

Robert Del Rey: is due to same as Facebook, YouTube lets you add a banner into your channel. So we agreed that the banner was looking a better a little bit dated. and yes, is supposed to send me a draft about an image, a new graphic. Or for that side of the channel. That's the only thing I'm working as far as design goes.

Robert Del Rey: I was wondering when maybe this is a question for the YouTube working group, but I was wondering When can we go live with the sitting committee videos So yeah, that's mainly. What we have with Akash due to the next YouTube working group call. Should happen.

Robert Del Rey: we didn't have it this week so next week is Every other week. So feel free to go in to get more involved in a cashew to efforts. I will stop real quick. In case someone has a question or comments about YouTube. Before going to see.

Robert Del Rey: If not, that's a thoroughly, correct? We have many shots channels that you can jump into and ask your questions or share your comments. We have the attitude Working group, we have the SIG Design Working Group in a cascade and also, we have the Cash City working group.

Robert Del Rey: Which is my next topic for this. I will share the screen real quick, then I hope you don't mind. I think over the screen. I wanted to share some of the s submissions we had. On ceiling.

Robert Del Rey: All right. I see the infinite mirror. Let me know if you can see my screen over here.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah. These are some of the submissions that we have pending for review at the moment.

Robert Del Rey: For a little context, on a cash slug designer mission. In this mission, we're inviting people to design appealing, merge for the cash community. We had some submissions, some of them are decent. Some of them are AI generated. Those submissions and low effort submissions. We are declining them but those look a little bit more appealing for me. Those past usually I ask myself Would I wear this? If the answer is, Yes, it's most likely that For example, this one I left it pending because I wanted to show you here. But this is something that I would for example,


### 00:10:00

Robert Del Rey: As you can see, it has their cash logo. I mean, as reference to a cash but also, it has phone graphics. You can see a little crown here. You can see a cache in phone letters, So yeah, it looks pretty nice. Usually, most of the submissions are As a stamping, the cash logo in a shirt and that's it. And sometimes you have a very oversized, a cash logo in a shirt and that's their submission. I reject those but this one I'm very inclined to approve This one. Moving on, we have this one too. This one it's in a shirt as you can see here.

Robert Del Rey: This is what I was talking about low effort, submissions, guys. Usually just add a graphic in urge into AMOKOP. Usually this get rejected. But I'm just going to show you so you can have a better idea how they look. The third one, we have current at the moment. This one is a bit more packed. As you can see, the logos are a bit funny.

Robert Del Rey: But it's kind of different design that is what we're looking for. I guess you can see the school. Had you have this combination of clothing? At least this guy submitted, different designs ideas. Usually, most of the people, they only submit one or two images like this one. So yeah, I want to extend invitation to the audience in the Design working group call. so, if you feel kind of inspired feel free to pass by silly, And in virgin be able to submit your creation. Possibly, this can make it into the cash shop and in the cash community can benefit of their community submissions. That's the idea we have behind this mission.

Robert Del Rey: So yeah other design that I really like it's here. This is actually the content submission that we have here. We are adding the best admissions we have on Sealy. Here, you will find guides images threats in Twitter videos. But for example, this submission, I really like this design a lot. The person told me he wanted to have this in a shirt you can see a cache. It's the public super cloud. I asked him I didn't understand send it to Super Cloud. I don't know what it meant.

Robert Del Rey: He has to explain me this. But something that I really like was in the bottom. He wanted to add different landmarks of different places that Cash is having conferences. This one is New York. As you can see, here is the current state. This one is the Empire State. This one is the Liberty Statue. and yeah, I mean, it looks Different, it looks good. So yeah, this one actually came from the designs of the previous sprint last month. so yeah, we actually liked this one out of all of the designs. This is the one that we like the most We approve four or five, but this is the only design that made it to taste. List of this document. And these are the ones that we have for the current sprint.

Robert Del Rey: So, yeah, that is what I wanted to share with you, hopefully to like those designs and hopefully, inspire you to take part in Seeley and…

Denis Lelic: Cool, thanks Robert.

Robert Del Rey: the Design Working Group.

Denis Lelic: Yeah I think we're pretty much aligned on all the submissions. last time we talked about not having any of those AI generated graphics, just because they're Not easy to do but it's like the lowest hanging fruit and It's very low rest. So it's kind of hard to produce that on graphic on a T-shirt and so So

Denis Lelic: But I do agree at the last graphic, you've shown. Ai messes up the letters but I do agree with the last comment you had for the graphic. You just showed in the dark, you can actually tell someone but some effort there. Think about it, design it, it's readable. It has design elements, it has some sort of a story with This distributed network. So, yeah, I agree. That's probably one of the best entries we had. but I loved the progress you're making with really, and, of course, I'm available, if you need anything design, related all, so on the front for the


### 00:15:00

Denis Lelic: I got YouTube channel. So as usual, I always try to keep this meeting. Open. So we're covering different topics but a bit from a high level where we can dig deeper is these working groups. So, if anyone is interested, we have working groups for the Akash YouTube channel.

Robert Del Rey: Yes, that is. I quickly forgot to say the secret word for Seeley. in Silly, we have a mission about the Design Working Group trying to incentivize people to join this particular call and hopefully get them involved in design. So, I say a secret word, They submit this work in the City mission and they get some extra XP points. Which convert to akat prices. So the secret word for the design mission, it's going to be the same. As always swag swag. I'll send it in the shed for the record and it's swag as W. A G.

Robert Del Rey: Yeah, you just want to quickly add that Daniel in case you are referring to the city mission. yeah, we are open to pretty much like any kind of merch you can see hats T-shirts, we even seen A six USB sticks. Notepads also logs. So yeah, feel free to be creative. Let me tell you, there was one person that submitted hurricanes Chord things and sheets and it was like a bedroom and a cash pin bedroom. Right? It was really funny. But ultimately, we're rejected it because


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: I mean, as a cash community members like that is not super appealing for the community. Usually things are more developer oriented and not like houses thought, if you know what I mean. But yeah, just wanted to share some talks about it.
