## Meeting Notes

### Introduction by Denis Lelic
- Monthly design meeting to review accomplishments, share plans, and focus on design projects like branding, merchandise, video content, and the website.

### Website Updates

- Continued efforts to enhance website areas with known user issues, with new tasks expected next week.
- Recently introduced a new serif font across presentations, social media posts, and events, aimed to unify Akash’s brand identity.

### Swag Shop and Merchandise
- Swag shop improvements are ongoing; Denis expressed interest in accelerating the process, despite other priorities.
- The team aims to add new items to the swag shop but faces limitations as merchandise is not a core business focus.

### Akash YouTube and Zealy Working Group Updates
- YouTube channel recently received updates, including new thumbnails. A banner redesign is underway to refresh the visual appeal.
- Next working group meeting is scheduled for next week to continue alignment on YouTube content and design.
- **Zealy Design Submissions:** Reviewing community-submitted designs for Akash merchandise:
  - **Approval Process:** High-effort designs with Akash branding are considered; low-effort or generic designs are generally declined.
  - **Popular Designs:** A few unique, Akash-themed designs (including graphics representing landmarks from Akash conference locations) were highlighted as top submissions.
  - **Encouragement for Participation:** Community members are encouraged to submit original designs for potential inclusion in Akash’s merchandise.

### Open Discussion
- New Members’ Introductions, Denis welcomed Daniel and David as new participants. Daniel clarified that he had attended a previous meeting.
- Design Submissions Scope: Discussion on design concepts, with Denis clarifying that designs should remain relevant to Akash's brand. Robert explained the broader range for Zealy submissions (e.g., hats, notepads, USBs) but noted that unrelated submissions, like home decor, may not be suitable.

### Closing Remarks
- Denis shared a link to Akash’s brand guidelines for those interested in creating designs aligned with the brand.
- Denis reviewed all agenda items and noted that the next monthly design meeting would occur as scheduled, while the next website-focused meeting would take place the following day.
