So just as usual I'm just gonna cover a couple of things that were happening in the past. So

Denis Lelic: Some website issues. were assault and we have a couple of new PRs that are kind of just one second. I just want to share the

Denis Lelic: just wanted to share the link to the old issues, so some of the issues already have been solved and we have a couple of new PRs that are hopefully gonna enhance the user experience across the website. So anyone who's interested or who might be looking at this recording, I dropped the

Denis Lelic: Akash network repo, and link to the issues. So, please have a look. The next thing would be events. It's been a busy month for events. A lot of them happening this September. so,

And next week, we have token 249 happening in Singapore and the end of the month, there's Masari and Rey Summit happening at the same time. So sick design, kind of supported all of these events with either, merge, giveaways, booth, designs, anything. Basically that's been requested by Events So yeah, using month ahead and as well. Next month, there's going to be

So yeah, a lot of work has been done on that front and while I was talking about the website I just realized I'm missed one thing and hopefully we're going to cover that. In the next month and that's the Swag shop redesign. So I'm thinking we're still gonna use the shopify. We're just going to update the items, maybe change the theme to another one. Make it a bit more visually pleasing. And yeah, we're just trying to elevate all the brand touchpoints.

If you guys want to talk about it, please go ahead.

Robert Del Rey: Sure, thanks. Denis. Let me start off with YouTube.

Robert Del Rey: So here you can see the YouTube studio for a cast YouTube channel. This is a video I uploaded yesterday just to see how the designs would look in YouTube and in the screen. So, first off is the thumbnail. So you can see, it's very simple talking about the steering company. Call number one in that India, Cash logo. I don't know if I can. Put it bigger. it's a bigger there, so yeah, really simple. But the magic is, when you click On this video to watch it, let me open up on your tab now. This is typical video. We try to put up together an intro card about these.

### 00:15:00

Robert Del Rey: You're? Briefly.

Denis Lelic: I mean.

Robert Del Rey: Go ahead and

Denis Lelic: Yeah, yeah. What I would add maybe just like a one sentence that says something about.

Denis Lelic: AI generated graphics. So I believe some of them would be good, but it's kind of hard to reproduce them. It's either low rest. there's no vectors in there. So to print them on a certain application. I've T-shirt up or anything, so maybe just some one sentence. That's kind of like Mentioning that we can't accept AI. And generated graphics.

Robert Del Rey: You guided Man, your wish is my command. I just added AI generated content. Submissions will not be accepted. Really. That's your work.

Since a lot of team members have been traveling in the previous week, some of them are still traveling either back home or to the next events. I suggest I keep this meeting a bit shorter than usual.

Denis Lelic: maybe a call to action to join working group meetings for either YouTube website is something as well. There was a lot of participation. In the previous meetings, We have a lot of new community members that are willing to contribute in either. So many new issues, fixing some of the stuff on the website, It's happening as well on the console side. the product side. So I know a lot of people are not in this meeting, but if anyone's listening or watching this recording, just want to thank you for

Denis Lelic: Either participating in the meetings or just trying to solve some of these issues. So, yeah, communities not just growing, but being just actively involved in different kind of groups. Let me just see when is the next meeting happening for the poor green group. and yeah, next Thursday, there's a working group meeting happening for

Denis Lelic: Akash website. there's a working group Zealing meeting happening next Monday, And Akash YouTube meeting happening Tuesday. So if anyone is interesting to join any of these meetings, let me just share the calendar really quickly.
