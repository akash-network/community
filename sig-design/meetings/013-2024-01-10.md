Denis Lelic: Hey everybody, and welcome to today's Sig design meeting. first one in 2024 we ended up. Last sick design with some swag stuff and I was just thinking if we could revive that topic a little bit. And have a look at the votes that posted in a Discord and just one second. I want to share my screen.

Denis Lelic: So surprisingly this one has the most 11 Volts for this one exploding cloud. And the second one would be the last one. It has 10 votes. So this is the third one number two nine votes. and then some of them only have a one vote or zero votes, so

Denis Lelic: Yeah for me personally. I was just wondering which of these design should we take to the next round which would be preparing the print files and setting up all the mockups and everything in our store

Denis Lelic: And what would be that the bar where we let the swag items into the store. So what's the minimum amount of votes to pass that line, so Designs could be transferred to the Shopify store.

Denis Lelic: on five Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: I mean that's like a reasonable number, the man and the max votes or one design were 11. so that's like half Let's say almost half.

Denis Lelic: so I'm just gonna make another list…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: where we include only the designs that passed the votes Yeah Zach.

Zach Horn: How many designs fall into that category that have more than five?

Denis Lelic: I think eight. Which is a good number.

Zach Horn: Okay.

Zach Horn: Yeah, totally. And these would be in addition to the kind of standard ones that we have. Right? So we have all the kind of clean simple corporate style logo ones. And then these eight would be added that. cool

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I would say so we have something a bit more corporate and safe. But we can also have something a bit more playful and these designs fall in that category of the playful one. So

Zach Horn: Yeah, totally. Yeah, there's tons of brands that do that they're very straightforward corporate stuff and then they play around with the brand a little bit experiment.

Denis Lelic: yeah, go ahead type.

Tyler Wright: Just one thing to add on the shop. I know that with the new website the shop will be more readily available and visible. Another thing that we've done Corey and over last week is really set down with printful and made sure that they're delivering the product on time and very quickly making sure that thing orders are going from Shopify to printful very quickly again. We are a

Tyler Wright: overclock and Akash is a web 3 tech company. We're not a retail company. So we use a third party print on demand provider and really do not look to make any money off of any product sold just like to sell on their costs to get them out to people in the world. So again, the products should be arriving faster than it has in the past and we got some styles that we should be using so that again product don't run that as quickly and then in addition. This is a role that we could potentially put some down to behind small bounty. We are looking for somebody that can help and has a design eye and a passion for design that can help design some of these Styles. I know Denis is a great job of mocking things up and creating the designs. Obviously, we're looking for other members of the community to help with that but once Denis finishes up the MOX, I mean move on to next

00:05:00

Tyler Wright: Each of creating these designs and adding them to the store certainly could use somebody from the community because I know denis' working on a number of design deliverables. So I just want to put that out there to anybody on this call that maybe want to get more involved on the design side. Here's a way to do it.

Denis Lelic: Yep, I agree. So I'm also going to share All the things you've mentioned in the Discord. So maybe there are some takers who are willing to play around with this and

Denis Lelic: So we may get alive, we don't leave it on a paper. Hopefully we're going to see some of these designs represented. I don't know on conferences. How far that maybe even in the streets.

Denis Lelic: the next topic and also something we left.

Denis Lelic: and the previous year we just mentioned it in the last meeting and hopefully this year we're gonna make a better progress creating video content meaning tutorials.

Denis Lelic: something Ray already did actually Robert

Denis Lelic: So personally I would like to be involved in that too and makes some of the tutorials for either. Akash in general or just providing tutorials for cloud nose console Trader stuff like that so we can onboard new users provide some learning materials and stuff like that. So that's one of my personal

Denis Lelic: goals and also part of the Sig design so I'm gonna reach out to Robert to see if he needs any help if he has any ideas.

Denis Lelic: So yeah, that's about it from my side agenda for 2024. Of course next to the bunch of other stuff. We have in the making of, just from the website and product and everything in between. Yeah Zach.

Zach Horn: to the point of video content As a suggestion what if you and I put together a video or two and really just do it exactly how we want for a couple reasons one because we can really obsess about it and use it all almost as a style guide and we can also decide we can knock off some of the early easy lowest hanging fruit examples of video content that we need how to deploy something on cloud most or whatever and then we can also take that to the community and to show people, how we want things to be done.

Denis Lelic: We could also, just in a separate call just start with a list. And see what exactly would we need and we can share that list and Sig Design Channel and see if there are any takers.

Zach Horn: Yeah, I like that a lot. I think we should still do a V1 internally. But totally on board with that.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I agree with we one but just after we won just having. Some sort of a list where we can continue and keep the momentum going.

Zach Horn: Yep, totally agree.

Tyler Wright: it's

Denis Lelic: I've also yeah Thai I saw your hand up. Sorry.

Tyler Wright: Gonna add I know the sick design is overseeing the working group for their cash website and that launch will be planned and made available soon. But in the meantime on the conversation you are talking about I know that on the Revenge website, there will be a specific area for Community contributions. That would be part of me. They'll be made very accessible for users trying to interact with the website. So this is the place where again a lot of these videos from folks that are contributing to Sig design can go as well as Zach has mentioned previously really looking to expand the YouTube strategy for 2024 on and so again some of these videos that meet that criteria that Zach and Denis are going to outline can also be added to the YouTube as formal

00:10:00

Tyler Wright: videos. So again, it's a couple places where this content can live.

Tyler Wright: The only other thing that I was going to do and I don't want to call somebody out, but I am calling them out. We are always looking for more contributions and I think I've seen B s here a couple of times and I would love to if you have the ability to a talk a little bit or maybe you can put in the chat about maybe some ways that you would like to get involved because again, we wanted to make it as easier for folks.

Tyler Wright: neither Zach nor myself nor denis' bite at all. This is a very inviting community at a class. And so we're always looking for folks that want to get more involved and real work into the night to help, support answer any questions no questions too down, but just help level anybody that wants to get involved so that we can get more contributors we have so many already in the community. But B's, I don't know if you have the ability to unmute or type, but I would love to learn a little bit more about you and maybe your skills that if you can or I think you put a message in Discord, but maybe something live and then maybe figure out how we can get you involved.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, thanks for joining Tyler.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: He just said he can't unmute at the moment, but he was able to type in the chat. Also, feel free to DM me in our Discord. or you can just drop a message into sick Design Channel if there's a certain area of design you're interested and want to

Denis Lelic: You want to contribute there? Just please let me know we can discuss all things Akash and design related and happy to See you here. Yeah time.

Tyler Wright: Absolutely, and I know we kind of talked about it prior to recording but I do want to put it on the record. I do want to shout out Zach and the rest of the team on I think hitting a hundred thousand followers on x / Twitter. I know that over the last year and a half of Zach being on board overclock Labs. There's been a night and day Improvement on messaging voice and just a real attention to detail and kind of what a cautious saying to the community and obviously it has served us well in connecting with a number of

Tyler Wright: large organizations individuals that really like the messaging they were putting out and want to continue to follow and engage with us. So I do want to shout out again hitting that 100,000. A followers and all the work that Zach especially but others have done to get us there. So just want to put down the

Zach Horn: Thanks, Tyler much appreciated.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, great achievement. I agree Tyler.

Denis Lelic: So that's about it. For today's sick design meeting. There's a number of projects currently going on.

Denis Lelic: One of the bigger ones are updating the cash website. and soon we're gonna transition into Cloud nose redesign

Denis Lelic: some of the other projects that I'm currently can share information about because I don't know if it's ready for public discussions. Yeah, and

Denis Lelic: just happy to see sick design evolving through throughout the first I think it's the first year, so recovered a bunch of stuff product product design and personally. I wish we had someone contributing consistently and maybe part-time.

Denis Lelic: on some of the design stuff We're currently working on. So if there are any takers out there, please let me know so It's not a specific. design related

00:15:00

Denis Lelic: a specific branch of design. So just like me. I wear many hats one day. I'm a product designer and another they like doing marketing stuff. So

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I wish we could find someone which is handy on many stuff and we can do some great. Things together events promotion is happening too. Yeah, that's right. that's something thanks for reminding me. I have to do a bunch of that stuff.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, brand guidelines. Thanks Tyler for bringing that up previously. We had this platform. I think it's called brand pad where we had the Akash guidelines hosted there. We were using free account and that platform decided they're going to cancel all of the free. members so basically have to pay for it and we're just gonna host that on our website and our GitHub basically on our own channels and we're gonna let that thing go.

Denis Lelic: So we got a message from b s I'm involved with Netta Dao help write it up our Constitution and the Juno Charter and we validate here on Akash as you guys know. I'm trying to attend more Akash meeting this year to increase. And that has understanding of a cash apps since we're voting on your gov props and we have kept us a breast. I hope I got that right that's a new word for me pretty well so far. So I'm just trying to create redundancy and help deepen our Castle of design but not a design unfortunately, but I'm dealing digging the new website. Okay, so I guess you saw the website. It's actually half old half new. We just added a bunch of stuff there a revamp happened and

Denis Lelic: we also merged a lot of other pages that were hosted externally like ecosystem and some of the others so we're just aiming to have unified experience under one domain one website. And hopefully we're going to see that live. There's a bunch of new things there. And happy to see that live. and happy to see Alani here, so a big shout out to Alani

Alani Kuye: Hi guys, how you doing? always awesome joining this meetings.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, good to see you here.

Zach Horn: Hey Alani, good to see you.

Alani Kuye: Hi Zach.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, we were just like this kind of discussing a bunch of design related stuff.

Alani Kuye: I had a very quick question.

Denis Lelic: Are one second.

Alani Kuye: I wasn't a meeting.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, go ahead.

Alani Kuye: last week with one of the cosmos chains and they are trying to set up a

Alani Kuye: something similar to a grant program basically and they wanted to model it after the accelerator grant program a cash had a couple years back. and I think I don't know how long ago the discourse Forum was sunseted. But they're just inquired if some of those old videos were available that they can reference as a template to setting up there.

Alani Kuye: Grant program for their chain and Tyler if you're online, I'm just a question for all of Tyler Zach Menace they were asking and I couldn't find the Forum because that's where those videos were posted when we have the weekly Paul would be Branch applicants and their demos couldn't find them anywhere. So I figured I'd ask, if those will be for records purposes around or they've been completely sunseted.

00:20:00

Denis Lelic: Tyler I'm gonna let you talk about that. I think you have the most information.

Tyler Wright: I believe there's a way to access them trying to look as we speak, but I'll make sure that you get access to the old form, but there is a link there. Let me look real.

Alani Kuye: That'll be cool. I mean I think with everything going on right now and Akash being in the news and all of that what we're seeing is a lot of chains saying, man, they obviously don't something right. how can we emulate some of the things they're doing? So those are some of the conversations that are coming out and I think it's a good thing because it shows the hard work you guys are doing and it's just fantastic.

Tyler Wright: The newer pair you were also a part of that hard work for a long time. So don't leave yourself out of that kids. But let me find that and I'll put a message somewhere publicly or share with you.

Alani Kuye: awesome

Denis Lelic: Yeah, there's also a Tyler. I know we talked about this during the working group for Akash website. We were also thinking about adding that maybe an updated or redign. form for the stuff you've been just asking Alani, so maybe we can chat on Discord or whatever and See what's going on there? Hi, I think I shared that type horn with you.

Alani Kuye: Of course.

Denis Lelic: So maybe now it seems like a perfect time to get back on that topic and see.

Denis Lelic: If we can make that live the future website update. So we can share that with Alani first.

Denis Lelic: cool So yeah, Alani just update you because you joined a couple of minutes later. Currently. We have a bunch of a car swag design items in the Discord. in the end of the previous month. We asked community members to cast their votes for their favorite design. So we have a bunch of designs community members and now we're going to just put it in our shop.
