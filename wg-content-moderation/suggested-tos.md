<h2 id="1">1. Preamble</h2>
This TOS sets forth terms under which users may access and use the services provided by PROVIDER_NAME on the Akash Network, across its decentralized Kubernetes clusters worldwide.

Your use or deployment on our platform constitutes your assent to be bound by these terms. If you disagree, you must cease usage immediately.
<h2 id="2">2. Definitions</h2>
Refers to decentralized applications, tools, software, or other functionalities managed, facilitated, or provided by PROVIDER_NAME within the Akash Network.

An individual or entity accessing or interfacing with our services, recognized solely via their Akash Network wallet identifier.

A decentralized model underpinning the Akash Network, driven by cryptographic verification and consensus protocols.
<h2 id="3">3. User Deployments and Identification</h2>
Users, autonomously and without direct PROVIDER_NAME authorization, deploy applications onto our Kubernetes clusters.

A userâ€™s identification is strictly limited to their unique Akash Network wallet. No additional personal identification is maintained or utilized by PROVIDER_NAME.

Users bear all obligations and liabilities associated with their deployments and content, ensuring full legal compliance.

User is exclusively responsible for securing and managing their Akash Network wallet. Any loss or unauthorized access is not within the purview of PROVIDER_NAME's responsibility.
<h2 id="4">4. Intellectual Property</h2>
Any content disseminated or deployed by users remains their sole intellectual property. Neither Akash Network nor PROVIDER_NAME stake any claim to it, transferring all content-related liabilities to the user.

Users shall refrain from uploading, sharing, or disseminating content that violates any statutory, regulatory, or common-law obligations or rights of any other party.
<h2 id="5">5. Nature of Decentralized Service</h2>
Engaging with decentralized platforms, inherently susceptible to network anomalies, software misbehaviors, and cryptographic inconsistencies, means the user assumes associated risks.

Given blockchain's irreversible operations, users must exercise utmost caution and discretion.
<h2 id="6">6. Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
PROVIDER_NAME services are provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.

PROVIDER_NAME does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to its services, given its decentralized structure.
<h2 id="7">7. Monitoring, Compliance, and Termination</h2>
For the sustenance of a harmonious ecosystem, deployments are periodically monitored for conformity with our <a href="https://PROVIDER_NAME/akash-network-acceptable-use-policy/" target="_new">Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</a>.

PROVIDER_NAME retains an irrevocable right to instantly terminate and erase deployments that breach this TOS or the AUP, with the Akash wallet serving as the sole reference.
<h2 id="8">8. Liability Provisions</h2>
By utilizing the services, users exculpate PROVIDER_NAME, its associates, and its entities from any claims, damages, liabilities, or losses stemming from the services.
<h2 id="9">9. Disputes and Governing Law</h2>
User waives all rights to commence or participate in any legal action or arbitration related to these services.

All disputes relating to this TOS shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Wyoming, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
<h2 id="10">10. Modification of Terms</h2>
PROVIDER_NAME reserves the right to revise this TOS. Continued engagement signifies your acceptance.

Substantial modifications will be communicated, with wallet-linked mechanisms being the primary contact mode.
<h2 id="11">11. Contact</h2>
