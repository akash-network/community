### Moderation API spec

- Anil put comments inside the pull request. Adam answered the comments.
- Pull request looks good to Anil, Jigar, and Deval.
- Andrew Mello thinks that the 2 API specs are focused on pre deployment. Andrew has been focused on post deployment solutions.


### Presentation from Andrew Mello

- Andrew has been working since last meeting on some code that he wants to demo today to the group with a focus on post deployment content moderation.
- High level, Andrew has learned that content moderation is expensive. The content can either be viewed onsite, or with a 3rd party tool (off-site). The 3rd party tools are expensive, but they will catch more. 
- The best solution for content moderation is a mix and match of on site and off site viewing tools. 
- Andrew walked through the code of how the content moderation works.
- Andrew wants to run a block so only Awesome Akash images can be run.
- Andrew showed a demo in siteengine to view and manage images that are being viewed by content moderation tools. 
- Andrew liked the experience with [Siteengine](https://sightengine.com/).
- After bad content is found, the deployment is automatically closed.
- It may cost around $100 per month. 
- Andrew Mello wants to button up the code and change everything into a variable. 
- Andrew wants to make it a docker file, so it can be running 24 hours.
- There are very few local models available. There is very limited capability for free or cheap.
- Perfomance was very good.
- ***Anil asked when you run this in practice, is it running a workload?*** Andrew said this will run anywhere with Kubeconfig. Down the line, this solution can be apart of helm.
- ***Anil asked if Andrew will put in the Akash Network Repo?*** Andrew Answer: yes.
- This solution will help large and small providers who have been concerned with moderation in the past.
- First 3 blocks will be :

1. Text/Keyword
2. awesome-akash repo images only
3. Sightengine API

### Action Items

- Adam asked Andrew Mello to make a PR with README, build and run instructions etc..
- Andrew to capture his work in the output for the content moderation working group.
- Adam is going to add a repo to Akash Network Organization in its own repo for Andrew.

- Anil to close Moderation API spec.
- Anil to close Management API spec.
