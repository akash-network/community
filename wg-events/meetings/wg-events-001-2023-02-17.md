## Meeting Notes

- Adam hinted that he will focus on the events highlighted in blue to keep the meeting on time, but other events listed in white may be discussed if time permits.
- Adam offers to share the proposal Doc with everyone on the call and mentioned that members can suggest additional events for consideration and the working group can judge them on a case-by-case basis
- Adam Wozney proposes focusing on Crypto and Cosmos events for the year
- Zach Horn emphasizes the importance of focusing on crypto events, as the UX can be challenging to explain outside of the crypto space
- Adam believes it is important for Akash to have a presence at these event due to the number of important players in the cosmos ecosystem attending.
- Adam Wozney suggested voting on which events to attend using a thumbs up or down reaction.


### Upcoming Events, July
- Adam proposes that a four-person team from Akash can participate in all these events over a two-week period.
- Adam suggested putting together a proposal for attending all these events and getting people on-site to activate at these conferences. Participants express agreement by giving thumbs up.
- AwesomWasm, EthCC, EthParis Hackathon, Nebular Hackathon and Nebular Summit are the events happening in July 

### Upcoming Events, September
- Adam Wozney also mentions two events happening in September, which are large-scale conferences related to the crypto space. 
- One of these events is Permissionless in Austin, Texas, organized by Bankless. Adam and Alani had attended the Permissionless event in West Palm Beach last year.
- Another one is Messari Mainnet: Adam describe it as the Bloomberg of Crypto, a well-respected event in the crypto space.
- Adam highlighted that members of Overclock Labs team will attend Messari Mainnet even if not included in the community proposal

### Upcoming Events, November
- Adam discussed three events that are yet to be determined in terms of timing but will happend in November:

Cosmoverse: main community conference in Cosmos, happening in Istanbul in the fall
DevConnect: large-scale Ethereum developer HACKATHON conference happening in Amsterdam
Devcon: the largest Ethereum developer conference in the world
Adam mentioned that attending these conferences can be valuable for Akash to have a presence and network with other projects in the space.

### Non-Crypto Events
- Adam discusses events that Akash could attend and proposes attending events that are focused on crypto and cosmos, although events like Kubecon and Google Developer Conference could be valuable for cost representation, but they are not so focused on crypto and there is not much of a cosmos presence.
- Joao expresses his opinion that Kubecon is important and that it would be good for Akash to be present at events that have a focus on cloud and big players in the industry. 
- Joao also thinks that attending the American Kubecon event would be good for Akash to broaden its presence beyond just crypto events.
-  Adam Wozney asks participants for their thoughts, prompting them to give a thumbs up if they agree or a thumbs down if they disagree to add Kubecon to the proposal.
- Most participants give a thumbs up, indicating agreement.

 ### Cost Estimating
 Adam Wozney explains his idea of estimating the cost per event to attend particular events and then multiplying it by the number of events agreed upon by the community to get a total cost. He suggests presenting this cost to the steering committee for approval. He also mentions the importance of having specific roles for each event and that it might not be necessary to have more than four people.
 
 ### Final Thoughts
The Group discussed the upcoming steering committee call and propose presenting the events budget during the call. They mention the need to allocate funds and resources for the events and discuss the next steps after the steering committee approves the proposal. They also mention the importance of diversifying the events and plan to add an agenda item to talk about proposed Akash events for the next steering committee call. They suggest putting feedback and notes in the Discord events channel before the call and encourage everyone to attend the call to give their feedback on the proposal.
