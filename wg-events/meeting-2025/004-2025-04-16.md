Hi everyone. Welcome to the working group events. Call of 2025 this is our April edition. We're just going over Akash, accelerate and quarter two events. So we will pause right there for any questions. So it actually, I wanted to ask everyone I know there are only three of or three of you right now, if you had plans to go to any or are planning on going to any conferences coming up in the next quarter two or quarter three,

Unknown Speaker  0:42  

still, there accelerate.

Amanda Keay  0:44  

Akash, accelerate. Of course, it's going to be so exciting. What about you? Rodri, sorry about that. Oh,

Maxime Beauchamp  0:52  

I have to go to something 43 but yeah.

Amanda Keay  0:59  

Where are you located in the world? If you don't mind sharing, are you in Europe? Yes, okay. Are you planning on attending ICC? Potentially. I know our team's not officially sponsoring that this year, but I know some people in Europe are going anyway.

Rodri R  1:15  

I do don't know I am planning. Yeah, it's almost time. I think. I think it's June, yeah, maybe May,

Amanda Keay  1:29  

yeah. I think so it's coming up. I know I've seen a couple of projects already start talking about it, but yeah, and definitely, I know if later in the year, in October, Cosmo verse just announced a couple weeks ago that they're going to be in Croatia. So I know we have some team members nearby, especially I know we have a design someone on our design team who's right in Croatia, so they're very accessible. But I saw shimpa was also planning on attending. So I have yet to hear, like many details from our team yet, about Cosmo verse and what the plan is for there, but that's technically quarter four, so that'll be a little bit later down the road. We have a lot of events this summer. So

Rodri R  2:18  

then I'm I'm planning on quarter four. I'm planning to go to customers, and shimpa said he will give us a tour. So we gotta take his word on that.

Amanda Keay  2:27  

Oh, you know, shimpa is the best at that. He's so good at giving the tour, and he's very animated. I love it so much. He was already saying, Oh, I'll know the best places to go. So we definitely need to take him up on that. I wanted to just ask really quickly a couple our marketing team and design team has a call this week to go over some ideas for Akash accelerate merchandise and giveaways. So if you have any ideas, I'm looking for things that are out of the box. This is our big conference this year. So if you have any ideas of something that would be a really awesome giveaway or an item of merchandise, drop it here in the messages I would love, or, you know, raise your hand. I would love to hear what you guys have in mind, because I'm open for everything. We're kind of deciding this week what we want. So would love to you have any good ideas, drop them.

Amanda Keay  3:33  

Well, if you think of things later, we can also drop them in the discord channel, um, and would definitely appreciate hearing from the community, or if there's any designs that you I don't know if you guys do design work. Would love to get the community involved as much as possible with some of those options, and then also get those cool pieces of merchandise on our Shopify account, so that people can order them if they want. That would be really awesome as well. But if no one has any questions, happy to Oh yeah, you got the Akash shirt? Love it. Awesome. I wear Akash swag all the Yep, spice must flow. Max has got it. So I just have New York today. But I always wear my I think I have at least 50 different Akash shirts. I wear them to bed every night, so I'm always representing. But if I don't, if you guys don't have any other questions, I'm good with closing this call a little bit early, and then we can definitely stay connected and also make sure you drop a like or whatever when the Akash accelerate gov prop goes live next week, I'll definitely be sharing in discord as well. But thanks for attending, guys, and look forward to seeing some of you at the conferences coming up. Have a great day and a good long, extended weekend.

Rodri R  4:59
