# **Transcript**

Denis Lelic: Hey, everyone, and welcome to today's working group meeting for Akash website before we get started. Can you hear me? You probably do, Okay, that's great. So

Denis Lelic: As usual, I suggest we have a look at the current state of the website and the issues. That are living in our github repo. I'll share it in the chat section, so you can follow along.

Denis Lelic: I'm gonna share this tab as well. So, Several things. Were solved in the previous, two weeks. So updating Akashi Ecosystem page with the latest relevant projects. There's a bunch of new projects that are currently available to have a look at in the Ecosystem page. So, if you have a look, Just click on the eco Page on the network and here you can already see Where we got the Venice AI Prime intellect and so And so, on, all of these were added Not too long ago, so I believe. In the previous week. So, It's good.

Denis Lelic: I'm gonna drop a comment here so We can just close this issue. We have three issues that were combined into one. They're good one PR. So I'm looking at Main and nav and secondary, nap redesign, and the second one is going to be case studies. And the third one is going to be

Denis Lelic: share this step as So main NAV review design and the secondary as well. So, adding case studies page and also, Reorganizing The two main network provider pages.

Denis Lelic: So, we're going to have Some of the work that was done by Piyush and Human Age. Queued team. So, the new menu experience kind of looks like this. So we're introducing dropdowns previously.

Denis Lelic: Users would have to click on each of these pages. And then in the next page, kind of select. What exactly do they want? But now we got these options and also on the secondary level. We are including these external links for Akash stats, Swag, shop product and engineering roadmap.

Denis Lelic: it kind of looks like this, so users can just click through. We got the Akash Network Providers page which is new as well, just the dedicated page for providers. Which two options. So Users can switch between network capacity and cache providers. So, in the capacity page, we can see all the resource that are currently offered. We have this map as well. And providers is basically just a list of all the providers that are currently on the network. So yeah, this is the secondary NAV. and this is, The new main nav where drop downs are introduced. So kind of works.

Denis Lelic: Like this.

Denis Lelic: And we got the case studies as well.

Denis Lelic: So if you go to the ecosystem page, there are three options which are showcase tools deployed on We Got and case studies are

Denis Lelic: It's already open. So we got case studies as well, and these are taking users to a Blog section where we have this tag with case studies and all of these are basically case studies. Per fold from the block section. Okay.


### 00:05:00

Denis Lelic: so, Currently this issue the PR is gonna combine three issues. The first one as I said is going to be the menu, second one is going to be the case studies and the third one is going to be providers just like a dedicated page or providers, but in the previous week or two weeks ago, there was Pricing and Earnings A new page that was introduced. It's reachable through the main menu right here so you click on it and then users are offered. This is a staging link I might as well. Through the live pricing and earnings. and we have a slightly redesigned GPU pricing page with

Denis Lelic: all the chipsets, we got this new thing here, which is kind of indicating how many available on Website chipsets are on the network. We got the pricing which is taking users to the console where they can directly. Run the GPU. So we got the second option here is Pricing Calculator. Users can hear use the slider

Denis Lelic: kind of play around with it and How much?

Denis Lelic: What it cost based on the selected resources here and the price here is provided. So at the same time, what are we doing? We're offering as well. Price comparison. with the Avs, Google and Microsoft. So we can see here as well. A percentage, how much Akash would be cheaper if we would go?

Denis Lelic: Akash basically. Yeah, so a call to Action to deploy now, which takes users to the console

Denis Lelic: So there's the third option as Well. Provider Earn Calculator. There's another slider where any user, who's basically interested in providing compute to the network. Can Play around with these sliders and see how much would they earn? if they decide to provide resources, To the network. So basically becoming a provider on the cash. So, There's the Total Monthly Earnings section. And it's also providing the same value in A Users can use the 30 day average price for Akt. So it's kind of change changes and we got the estimated breakdown How much would

Denis Lelic: A provider earn on a specific resource, so such as memory storage and so on and so on. so yeah, this is kind of new addition to the website and there's plenty of

Denis Lelic: issues. As you can see here, that needs to be solved and hopefully we're gonna improve their experience. We cover a week and month after month. So we're adding new things where we will be adding A new pages, new sections and so on and so on and so on. So yeah, that's about it for covering what's been done? In previous, So in the next two weeks, there's A couple of issues that are as well. I would like to solve one would be, of course, the issue we just talked about. So, the main NAV providers and the third one was

Denis Lelic: Case Studies. So I would like to merge that as soon as possible so we can build on top of that. So I'm thinking we should have a look at the developers page. In kind of look for ways to enhance.


### 00:10:00

Denis Lelic: On the whole experience there. So I'm talking about this page, so development, We're standing off with open source community getting started, and so on, and on, and a calendar as well. It's quite heavy with

Denis Lelic: With text. So I was just thinking What can we do to make sure this page is kind of a bit more inviting. So we're kind of splitting all of this content into different Shapes and forms sections and so on. So it's kind of easier to digest and we are leading the user.

Denis Lelic: With information would call the action and so on and so on. So you basically already have an issue created for this and think it's was the first one that was created by Tyler, but it kind of evolve over time. So as you see here, I've added some ideas.

Denis Lelic: maybe we start here. So we're kind of looked like We would just split all of that text and provide different resources. I got to share So I was just thinking about, Distributing that content into smaller digestible pieces. So users could consume that in which more visual appealing way.

Denis Lelic: Along with that, I think we can include a community calendar, a bit more prominently, and we would basically create a sticky button and If we use it as high as to click on it, it's going to just pop up and open up all the meetings that are happening today. But it is also an option to switch between monthly daily view, and so on and so on.

Denis Lelic: And I think we have another.

Denis Lelic: this one is talking about community groups. Again, we have this new menu experience here, but the community groups are kind of presented this way are often three switches between six working groups and steering committee. And this can just play around. And visit all of these groups have a What's happening in Github discord when the meaning is happening. basically information for the specific group, Let's see, what else do we have here. So we have the first page of the development. So get involved. I was thinking if we could

Denis Lelic: offer some of the resources that are currently living either in Akash network support discussions like Github docs all as the Kind of like they go to deployment tool, external links for how to contribute code of conduct. We can also showcase some of these

Denis Lelic: Akash network GitHub, a repose. And there are open source so we can highlight some of those again community groups. As I said the six working groups and Extreme Committee maybe we can showcase some of the popular deployment templates as well. So, this is just the draft, it's still working in progress, so, Hopefully, we're gonna reach the stage where we're gonna say, it's ready for implementation, send it out to any takers who are willing to work on this. If someone is interested, please drop a comment here and I'll make sure to review it. We're gonna plan it and so on and so on.

Denis Lelic: yeah. I think we kind of covered what happened in the past was gonna happen in the future. So if you guys have any questions, feel free.

Denis Lelic: to ask, of course,

Denis Lelic: or if you find something and you think we need a new feature, we need a new addition. On the website. You can always create an issue in the website. Keep Github repo and you can discuss it over there. Yeah. Robert go ahead.

Robert Del Rey: Thanks Denis, first of all a great job. Only what you actually doing here, it looks. Really.


### 00:15:00

Denis Lelic: Is it just me? But I can't hear you. Maybe it's my

Robert Del Rey: But once.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, Robert. Can you try again? I just unplug my headphones. maybe I'll be able to hear as I saw your hand went up but I'm not sure.

Robert Del Rey: What about now?

Robert Del Rey: Still.

Denis Lelic: I can't hear you, sorry.

Denis Lelic: But I hope all of you guys can hear me. So, I hope that all of that chitchatum went to nothing.

Denis Lelic: And I say, peers just joins so Piyush is one of the main contributors to the Akash website. But I guess I'm having some speaker issues piyush. If you want to talk and the rest of the crew can hear you go ahead. We just covered some of the issues that are

Denis Lelic: That were solved and some of the issues that you worked on such as the new menu Experience and Case Studies, and Providers page. We had a look at the interview pricing page as well, which is live already. I think The issue. You have any words feel free to speak otherwise if you're not currently, can't speak if you're traveling or anything. We can always talk on discord as well.

Piyush: Yeah, so I think most of the issues have already been covered by So instantly as we all know, we have revamped the whole pricing page, which is already on the website. But integrations of GPU pricing uses calculator as well as the provider and calculated. And the next issue that we are going to resolve is the completely wampbox the Navigations. So, as the number of pages are going, it is very important to event how the navigation is being updated, moving forward to provide an easier access to all the pages that is coming in. So I think that's pretty much it.

Piyush: we were also working on providers integrations The providers page is expected across under the ecosystem. what we'll be doing is we'll just launch a dedicated provider page. We're integrate all the resources related to the providers. Yeah, that's very much from my side.

shiny dev: Thanks for your

Denis Lelic: But I have no idea of anyone is talking. I see Piyush, I see. Robert is not muted as well, so just please let me know in the comment section when you guys finish. Sorry.

shiny dev: That's okay.

Robert Del Rey: Can you guys hear me now?

Piyush: Yeah, we can hear.

Robert Del Rey: Okay, you both hear me? Denis, I don't know if you don't hear me. That's totally fine. Let me say what I want to say. First of all, the Web page is coming up. Really good. Thank you for this effort, guys. I want to go to the Community tab. Denis, mentioned That if we have ideas, For making this page more welcoming to the community, which is shared them, and I believe the calendar. It's a great first step. I would think about,


### 00:20:00

Robert Del Rey: About the cold recordings they call recordings. We're gonna upload them on YouTube. So I guess instead of letting people know that we have these calls which should show them that we have these scores and they have it. And how we have it. So, for example, in this section that's this working groups. Maybe we can add a video for the Syrian Working Group call and that can be a good example for people who want to get more information about the city calls and the working group calls, but that was the quick feedback. Maybe. Videos about the working group calls so people can see right away what they are about instead of really about them. Hopefully, that makes sense. and yeah so far it looks pretty good.

Robert Del Rey: Another common that I would say. It's about community contributions.

Robert Del Rey: I don't know if you ever thought about making it easier for people to Click on something. And have a PR ready for them to fill it up and submit the community contribution staff. I remember it was suggested a while ago. And the goal for that was to let the same community member of load, the things they do on a cache onto the Akash website so it's still possible, right?

Robert Del Rey: But it's not as clear or as easy as it could be, in my honest opinion. So maybe that's something that you can consider. Those are the two main points I can share it over. and besides that, everything looks really, really cool. I especially like the pricing a page and how the GPUs look when you look for them. And since I happened, Mike, let me say the secret word for In case somebody it's interested. Remember it's w W or Word Y Web. And that was my Ted talk. Thank you guys.

Piyush: Yeah. Thanks Robert. I think that's a great suggestion. So we'll definitely look into it. So, special issues that are open. I think we already have a plan. To make it easier for the committee members to contribute to the website. There will be extending the community contributions from shark to also allow them to write the blocks right now. What are contributions the community wants to make in terms of blog, they go to the blog page but moving forward will probably integrate the block functionality to the Community Contributions page. So the contributions made by community space, when the community contributions and the official things stays on the block. So yeah, that's the plan and hopefully, Will be able to recommend it very soon. Thanks.

Denis Lelic: Thanks Piyush. I just dropped out of this meeting and rejoined so I can hear you guys Robert in the chat section. I've shared A link to the github repo of the cash website. So, if you just scroll down a little bit Piyush, did a great job and

Denis Lelic: there's a section how to contribute to Akash website, I'll drop the link here. So it says, how to contribute to the Akash website? there's a detailed guide, how to write a blog, how to add new events, edu, how to contribute to the community contributions, how to add projects to the ecosystem and so on and so on and on. So everything is there. But yeah maybe we just need to highlight that somewhere on the website. so,

Denis Lelic: Maybe we'll provide a link in the section of community contributions and just link to that thing that I've shared in the chat section. And of course, as Piyush said, We're going to introduce a complete new section for the community can be contributions where a Britain blog post could live and of course, many different things. So sorry again, for I couldn't hear you previously. So, I had to drop out of this call and rejoin. And it works if I turn on my VPN somehow.


### 00:25:00

Robert Del Rey: It's Google. Don't want you to use VPNs as a reason.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Robert Del Rey: And thanks The instructions actually look really clear.

Piyush: He?

Robert Del Rey: I just didn't know this existed. So thanks again for sharing.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, no worries. Yes Piyush.

Piyush: Also like to highlight that.

Denis Lelic: Go ahead.

Piyush: So for the past few months, we were working on a solution that would allow the users to deploy their application directly from GitHub on the docs network. So we were testing the feature internally and it's performing really well. So, hopefully within the next few days or probably weeks to be weeks, it will live on the official console site. We have also received a community grand for the same, so,

Piyush: I hope this feature will bring in a lot of users, both because it will just eliminate the needs for the users to know how to write an SDL, how to create a Docker knowledge. they just can connect their GitHub. the first three, they want to deploy and just hit the block button on with Akash console. So The feature is limited to how Python applications. We can say, whatever is deployable on versa or random will be deployable in akashed through this picture. So yeah, that's all for myself. It's a little bit out of context but yeah, a little bit from our side.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I think that's Of course, a great addition to the Council, but on the other hand, we can think how can we help and support and make that new feature visible on the website?

Denis Lelic: we were talking about the development page, maybe there's a section there that's going to be Talking about that, maybe we're showcasing some templates where maybe just guiding traffic through the website. To the console and highlighting that feature. So, everything is connected. so, No worries about, That not being the topic today. So everything is kind of connected one way or another.

Piyush: Yeah, for sure.

Denis Lelic: So I think I pretty much covered anything everything that I planned today. So, a lot of work to do will make sure we're always making progress.

Denis Lelic: And of course, guys, if you need any design support, any questions that I can answer, I'll be happy to answer, Feel free to the enemy on discord. We always drop any thoughts and working group for the website on discord as well. So if you guys have anything else to cover, we still have some time. Otherwise, we can wrap it up for today.

Denis Lelic: I see a thumbs Thanks again for joining I think we'll see each other again in two weeks. But in the meantime, let's keep the momentum live on Discord and Github.

Denis Lelic: you soon. Take care. Have a good day. Bye.

Piyush: And I was able, but

Robert Del Rey: Thanks for this place that guys.
