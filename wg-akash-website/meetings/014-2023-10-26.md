## Meeting Notes
### Website Revamp Progress:
- Piyush Choudhary provided an update on the website development progress and structure, mentioning that the foundational structure is almost complete.
- Piyush mentioned that after discussions with Dennis, there will be some changes to the design and content.
- Piyush described the homepage and the upcoming changes to the "get started" page, which will be integrated into Akash documentation.
- Arthur asked about the high number of menu items on the website.
- Piyush Choudhary acknowledged the issue and mentioned that he would discuss it with Denis to reduce the number of menu items.
- Emmanuel suggested the possibility of using dropdown menus to organize related pages.
- Denis explained that in the past, dropdown menus were avoided due to restrictions from the Hugo template, and they preferred direct links to pages. However, they are open to reconsidering this approach if it becomes too crowded.
- Piyush Choudhary mentioned that within ten days, he could make the necessary changes for the new website to be launched.
- He suggested that even if real-time pricing data takes more time to implement, they could make the website live initially and add real-time features later.
#### Docs Integration
- Denis provided clarification regarding the history of the get started page and the Docs and its integration into the website..
- He mentioned that they initially created a get started page before bringing the docs into the website.
- Now, with Piyush and his team working on bringing the docs and website together, they are considering integrating the get started page into the Akash Docs.
- Denis emphasized the importance of integrating the "get started" page into Akash Docs to create a centralized hub of information for users.
- Denis explained that clicking on topics like "deploy an application" would lead to a page with Cloudmos and additional deployment resources linked to the same environment within the docs.
- Piyush mentioned that he had access to the docs but needed to integrate the to the website from scratch. He wanted everyone to review the content that had been created for the new docs.
- Denis Lelic expressed understanding and asked Piyush to share the content for review.
- Tyler Wright suggested that Piyush post a message in the Akash website working group channel to ensure clear communication, especially involving Scott in the conversation.
#### Website content and data sources discussion
- Piyush highlighted that all content comes from markdown files, making it accessible for non-technical individuals to update.
- Piyush mentioned the token page and price metrics, which will be fetched from Cloudmos APIs.
- Denis Lelic discussed the possibility of extracting network activity data from Cloudmos, particularly for the development section.
- Piyush explained the need for data from Cloudmos providers for three pages: pricing calculators, analytics, and network activity.
- Piyush mentioned that once the APIs are provided, they will implement real-time data on the Akash website, making the content dynamic.
#### AI assistant on the Akash Website 2.0
- Denis Lelic requested Piyush to access the Akash Web 2.0 Figma file.
- Denis pointed out the support page on the Figma file and discussed the idea of implementing an AI assistant on the support page.
- The AI assistant would allow users to ask questions and provide different resources in response.
- Piyush expressed that it's a good idea and suggested integrating an AI system on the page. It could handle various user queries and technical issues.
#### Tools and Apps to be featured on new website
- Denis discussed the need to replace a console on the website and suggested considering what kind of tool or app could be placed there.
- He mentioned that since they are sunsetting the console, they have the opportunity to feature a different tool.
- Zach Horn discussed the idea of [featuring SDXL](https://sdxl.akash.network/) on the Akash website and how it can serve as a touchpoint for users to experience Akash's computing capabilities.
- Tyler Wrexpressed support for the idea of showcasing SDXL and other AI-related apps on the website.
- Zach Horn expressed the desire to surface SDXL on the Akash website, as it allows users to experience Akash's computing capabilities by providing prompt-based image generation in seconds.
- Zach suggested integrating SDXL into the homepage section or creating a dedicated section for demos, allowing users to try Akash quickly and serving as a call to action for Akash AI/ML and GPU-related deployments.
- Tyler mentioned that he had experimented with these apps and emphasized the value of showing real deployments on Akash.
#### website revamp and pricing information
- Tyler noted that the new website will significantly improve the ability to answer common user questions regarding how to use Akash and the associated costs.
- Zach Horn commended the pricing page views, emphasizing their value and how much it has been needed.
- The group discussed the importance of addressing user questions about the cost of using Akash for various compute needs.
- Denis suggested the idea of having ready-made packages for users, such as general-purpose, GPU-optimized, and memory-optimized, to simplify the process.
- The need to display bids, potentially pulled from the console, was mentioned.
- Tyler noted the need for a team effort to ensure the accuracy and consistency of pricing calculations, as different tools currently yield varying results. 
- The collaboration with Cloudmos and core team members was mentioned
#### Discussion on pricing information and the complexities of calculating
- Scott Hewitson emphasized the complexity of pricing in an open marketplace like Akash and compared it to hosting on Airbnb, where earnings depend on various factors.
- Tyler Wright acknowledged the complexity and mentioned the need for some level of standardization. 
- He referred to a support tool built by Scott Caruthers for simulating deployments and suggested using real-time pricing data to calculate accurate prices.
- Zach Horn proposed showcasing deployment pricing on the website, allowing users to filter by specific configurations, such as Nvidia A100, and see the current pricing on the network. 
- He acknowledged the complexity of implementing this but highlighted the potential value it could provide.
### Deployment Page Task
- Piyush suggested assigning the task of moving a page back to its previous version to Arthur, as he had implemented the code.
- Emmanuel Arthur volunteered to work on this task.
- Denis Lelic and Piyush clarified that the task is to reverse the order of sections on the "deploy" page
- Piyush mentioned that the deploy page needs to be changed to refer to Cloudmos instead of console
- Denis Lelic suggested focusing on removing the console and just having the Cloudmos page initially
- Tyler Wright emphasized the importance of prioritizing the removal of the console and redirecting users to Cloudmos since the console is deprecated.
### Other matters Discussed
#### Homepage Hero Section Concerns
- Tyler Wright raised a question about the homepage hero section, expressing concerns about it being text-heavy compared to other websites.
- He shared a [link to an article](https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/tech/a-deep-dive-into-the-most-promising-projects/) featuring Akash Network, showcasing various website headers.
- Tyler suggested considering the addition of visual assets such as decentralized network or hardware imagery to enhance storytelling.
- Denis Lelic expressed support for the idea, mentioning that the current direction was inherited from the previous website.
- Denis suggested exploring what can be done to improve the hero section and researching current trends in other projects

## Action Items

Denis Lelic: Welcome everybody to today's working group meeting for Akash website. I hope you're all doing well. so these meetings happen every week on Thursday. I'm not sure it's What Pacific time is that Tyler? Sorry?

Tyler Wright: You're fine. It's Eastern Time. 6:30 AM Pacific.

Denis Lelic: Okay, sounds good. So yeah. Maybe we just kick it off and start with the latest of the updates from piyush and his team they've been working on the website revamp for the last couple of weeks. And basically every week we have a look at the progress they made. Later on, we're answering questions. Make sure there's no blockers and we keep this thing moving and progressing. A H they have anything to share.

Denis Lelic: Any updates from last week?

Piyush Choudhary: if I'm sharing with

Denis Lelic: Thanks.

Piyush Choudhary: Is my screen visible?

Piyush Choudhary: So I've dropped the link to see it live on your sleep you can check out this link that have talked in the chat Suite Life. So mostly we are almost done with the foundational structure. We have almost worked on all the pages but after discussions with  Dennis today privately, so there are some weeks that will be made the design and also the content that has been decided and also I would ask all the quality numbers to talk to the content of all the pages including development community and about sages. So if you look at the overview of the website We have the home page. We have the blog page. We have getting started page. But this getting started page would be moved to the docs as per this plan. So.

Piyush Choudhary: So they're talking about it later. I've seen discussions and then we have the token page ecosystem page about page lesson branding page across Community page and lastly development page and it comes to the content right? So we have three About page development page and Akash Community page that contains the general contents. And then lastly we have the dogs which contains the overall structure or guidance tutorials or whatever, So if we look at the development page, right, so this is the development page right on the left hand side in the files.

Piyush Choudhary: Or the content files that we can change and the content will appear here and on this page, but after seeing the recent designs, so we'll be taking it a little bit only this part will remain here and on this space section will be removed and the content will be expended because after being somebody search as I can see in the designs done by many. if we talk about the content of and so these things

Piyush Choudhary: So this list of projects it has five columns if we keep the only space section which is designed by us. Then it will make Things look very compressed and it will not be good. So for three pages development community so these three pages are not kind of tutorial but be basically a kind of location the general details about what's happening because the recent development proposal is a job. So we'll be removing this section and will be extending this middle content to the whole page. here incidentally

Denis Lelic: Yeah, Regarding this menu on the right side. It's called on this page. I think that's something we're just inherited from the previous page and who go template.

Denis Lelic: So my suggestion would be like to kick it out if in case we don't need it. That's something that's often used in the docs.

00:05:00

Piyush Choudhary: reading this

Denis Lelic: but If the content is shorter, there's not So Much Information going on and I think there is no need for that and we could expand the main content. and just there's gonna be much more real estate for the main content and the focus of users could be centered around the main content

Piyush Choudhary: yeah, it shows so.

Piyush Choudhary: so there are three pages basically in the whole website related to subscribe so that would be Affected by the state one is a development which as you can see one is a community contributions with and when it's about page for this key pages will be affected and this on this space sections will be out and on this space actually will be kept in the docks because it's usually captained at all because we have the bigger contents and on this space section such as the navigate to the full contents, so we will just take it out and well as for the middle text will be expand into the right completely on the left part of the cap as it is that you are seeing on the screen.

Piyush Choudhary: this is the homepage that you are looking so we have get started page and get started H. We have two pages to plan applications to become a provider. And this all will also be kicked out and customize your account should experience in the product and people start from here this stage. So we implemented only the cloud notes because Council console support has been discontinued from nonverbs. So this is what the get started which looks like but later as for the new designs the get started page will be made to be a part of a cost talks because documentation still have the home page. I sell the direction by Denis. So this on page helps us is the overview of stocks and accordingly. We will Implement our cost documentation as well.

Piyush Choudhary: And this is all about get started page. I think it has all been discussed in the past. So there's not much but there are some changes that will be made to the homepage. For example. We talk about joined the terminating so these thoughts so we have two options to make this cards Dynamic one. We subscribes to the Twitter API which costs around thousand USD per month and then implement the API endpoints will be displayed in your time. we can just have the markdown file we bear we just have to Keep on updating only three to four details, for example. the content of the text the username and the image so this three things will be

Piyush Choudhary: updated in the markdown file and we can call it instead of following pictures. Let's say someone tweaked a good thing or let's say we want to show the Weight on this page, right? We can just implemented with text into the modern file into the display here like this as you see or if we want to keep things Dynamic then we can subscribe.

Piyush Choudhary: So this is the homepage they were saying on the screen and we have the development page. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I know there's some hands up but my vote is certainly for the markdown file approach because I don't think those testimonials are. that big of action but I saw that Arthur had his hand up and then Dennis.

Piyush Choudhary: Okay.

Emmanuel Arthur: Can you guys hear me?

Emmanuel Arthur: Yeah, I want to ask why we have so many. Menu items at the now back. Thank you guys do something about it.

Piyush Choudhary: Yeah, so I will have a chat with the in to minimize the things because I also personally feel like we are having a lot of menu items in the network, but I always get the direction because the pages has been increased the same place. So I always get the direction to keep things.

Emmanuel Arthur: Maybe a drop down will help.

00:10:00

Piyush Choudhary: I think we can combine you menu items or…

Emmanuel Arthur: Keep them.

Piyush Choudhary: cities and can have a drop-down for example. Let's say development community so these three pages are mostly related to each other so we can have a single headline here. And when we go over it the development community and about section drops down. Or we can keep it like this as well.

Emmanuel Arthur: 

Piyush Choudhary: This. and it's yeah you

Denis Lelic: Regarding the menu items. Previously, I don't know why maybe it was because of restrictions from that Hugo template we use but I know Greg was avoiding any dropdowns. He wanted Direct. links to the pages so we kind of Kept that idea and…

Piyush Choudhary: he

Denis Lelic: just keep on adding new items up there. But if We have a good argument that not working. It's getting clustered and overcrowded. We can always say here's the solution we discussed that here are the problem. And so on and yeah, we can do something about it for sure and regarding a couple of other things piyush mentioned just to provide some.

Denis Lelic: clarification around it a while ago I have no idea when that happened, but Luna was also part of this calls and I was also a discussion and working group for Akash documentation where we discussed to get started page around in the Akash Docs. but it took some time to

Denis Lelic: Develop and bring those dogs into the website. that's why we kind of just a get started page. Before we brought docs page into the website, but now since we have piyush here and his team and they're working on to bring the dogs. And the website together, so we have this experience in. One website we could get started page into the Akash Docs.

Piyush Choudhary: he

Denis Lelic: and it would provide

Denis Lelic: one Hub of information. So anyone who's trying to get started will be served with additional items are in the menu bar. on the left or for example, if you click deploy an application you'll be presented with a page with Cloud nose, but again, we can list additional deployment resources at the bottom and it's going to link to the

Denis Lelic: Same environment meaning it's gonna stay in the doc's page. so that's something I Changed in the last week. of course. We haven't discussed this until now so I just provided some context context around it for Zach Taylor and…

Piyush Choudhary: You right.

Denis Lelic: Arthur and emph was just talking this morning. About it. So if you have any comments any suggestions like I Arthur please let us know we can always Change or adapt the direction.

Denis Lelic: and one additional thing would be

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: yeah on the homepage. We had couple of tools to get you started. And a couple of templates listed there. But now we have one space available for consoles and to replace the console. So I was just thinking about what kind of tool or app we could place here. Yeah Thai

Tyler Wright: A couple cool question. I just threw something this is related to the homepage. So I don't want to cut off what you're talking about with the model section, but on the banner. And this is just an open discussion on the banner section. I just threw a link in the chat that an article came out that features Akash Network and in these Banner image shots, it shows basically I think the header Banner for all the various website. I feel compared to some of the other folks in the space. Our better Banner is a little bit text heavy versus having text and some imagery or maybe some background imagery. I just wanted to open that up to discussion very briefly to see if anybody else had any thoughts comments.

00:15:00

Tyler Wright: questions or Should we just keep it as is and…

Denis Lelic: Are you talking about the hero section with the headline?

Tyler Wright: just continue to move forward?

Tyler Wright: Yeah exactly. I'm not saying that headline should go but I wonder if we want to add any sort of accompanying visual assets that maybe show a decentralized network or some more like Hardware or something, that maybe the increases the storytelling or maybe it's not necessary. I just want to open it up to the group for discussion.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I'm totally for it. I think this direction we have at the moment is something again. We inherit it from the previous website. So I think everyone was just trying to be respectful of the previous website and the direction and Greg has set ups so Yeah, just with the dropdowns we can say. Here's an idea. And this is why we think it's It was part of this discussion in this working group, and we can also provide examples how other projects

Denis Lelic: hero section looks like and when it's listed together, for example, in the link you've provided we can say Hey, we're kind of lacking. We need to step up our game.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I'm just gonna add that an action item. for the next week that maybe explore what can be done here and Maybe explore what are the trends at the moment what other projects are doing and so on so on?

Piyush Choudhary: So I think we are in good pets. So I'm just giving our view again.

Piyush Choudhary: So we have the homepage then we have superstars that are ready for maintain about which contains the general contain contents. Whatever is meeting such a talk, and then we have the tops that will be kind of percent of the tutorials or Royal. And then we have the ecosystem page which has already been done. And the good thing is everything is coming from the maldon files. So even a non-technical person should be able to implement the new projects at the new projects as well. And lastly we have to open page and doesn't page metrics will be patched from the cloud most apis. Just so that in the new design file there is pricings and some guidelines for example

Denis Lelic: It might be looking at network activity. It's part of the development.

Piyush Choudhary: we have so yes.

Denis Lelic: Yeah. there's some data we could pull from cloud nose. especially around network activity

Piyush Choudhary: so there are three pages that we need data from the cloud nose providers when it's pricing calculators one is analytics. So I asked for the API and points all the way to fetch the data from all these three pages in your time. So in the Discord the chat of cloud mods already. So once that is provided will be able to implement that on the cash website as well. So we will kind of have a details on the cloud most website as it is and we will also have the details on the official website as well. for example, if I go to about section when I click on the pricing? this presentation will be dynamic and you just be able to scroll up down and presentation expected guys, but

00:20:00

Piyush Choudhary: We need to have some kind of detail salts some guidance. Although I found they play but there are some Arrow sign getting I just need a little guidance from the problem or stream on how to catch the real-time data from the

Denis Lelic: Yeah, there's one thing.

Denis Lelic: Tyler mentioned a couple of minutes ago. This price needs to be in the navbar. we could move that and just keep it in the photo section. I'm not really sure how much traffic we get on. discussions

Denis Lelic: because we already have the GitHub button over there.

Piyush Choudhary: 

Piyush Choudhary: and I think we can remove this from the navbar as well discussions.

Denis Lelic: But we do mention discussions in the homepage right away. when we have a call to action join the community and then we have a couple of testimonials there above that.

Piyush Choudhary: when

Denis Lelic: There's GitHub discussions I think in your button you're just missing discussions inside so

Piyush Choudhary: If so, yeah, I will demand the discussion with them.

Denis Lelic: So we could reduce the amount of items in the navbar just kicking out. press

Tyler Wright: Real quick on the back of the homepage real fast. just I know that I get the steering committee has been moved to next Wednesday as a part of the steering committee. I was hoping that piyush I think you already talked about this is going to give a short demo of the progress for the website. I think everyone will be excited to see ahead of that. I would just love and I know this is low priority right now, but ahead of that meeting. I know that we made some adjustments to the current website to adjust the language from access gpus to reach out. I would love to keep that consistent so that it doesn't become a point of distraction, turn that demo.

Piyush Choudhary: yeah, sure. Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, maybe you just have a look at the sigma file. I've updated it there.

Piyush Choudhary: if I

Denis Lelic: So we have deploy now and additional button to reach out.

Piyush Choudhary: I serve. So yeah,…

Denis Lelic: yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: By first number I think I'll be able to update these days as well by keeping out on this way sections. And yeah, I think by first talk no, but they will be more progress and fixes Final Fix so I think there is one item that we can assign to.

Piyush Choudhary: Arthur if you guys don't know

Denis Lelic: Which one?

Piyush Choudhary: this page moving back to the previous version because I think he implemented the code so it will be possible for him to move back this base to the previous version.

Emmanuel Arthur: up yeah, I would like to work on this and

Piyush Choudhary: 

Tyler Wright: Share with that at all. So is that one of the open issues that we talked about a couple days ago that we would just want to hand over to?

Piyush Choudhary: Yes.

Tyler Wright: Let's see. I know assistant change. The order has happened done. Let me just

Tyler Wright: Sorry, I'm talking a lot. So we have a couple of issues. I think one's closed but we have This issue that was opened a couple days ago by myself here. She did something that you also want Arthur to handle. the order of the section that get started as well as that main page.

Piyush Choudhary: So we definition.

Denis Lelic: It's just reversing the order. So we start with deploying.

Piyush Choudhary: Yeah, so basically only there is a change on this deployed page so right now is we can see we have two sections apart on soil and…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: crowd most we just want to keep the clock Mouse on this page as well the directions so I think that instant Denis…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: then just share the pigma political also for this page and also can just reward the code base and the implement the previous versions as for what it usually

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I think that's clear I guess additionally. have you already implemented the saw for issue 279 or is that something you also want Arthur to do?

00:25:00

Piyush Choudhary: With chemical means I didn't check they should presentation.

Tyler Wright: yeah, no problem.

Piyush Choudhary: That's myself.

Piyush Choudhary: can you tell what it is related to? Is it opened recently?

Denis Lelic: It's part of this.

Tyler Wright: Yes. Then you could…

Denis Lelic: Yeah, go ahead.

Piyush Choudhary: I think

Tyler Wright: if you can move up to page a little bit to get started if you can click on the get started tab piyush.

Piyush Choudhary: we have

Tyler Wright: perfect on this page the leftmost tile is access high performance gpus Basically,…

Piyush Choudhary: yeah.

Tyler Wright: the direction is we want to switch these tiles. So the deployed application should be the first tile that you see and then the access high performance GPU should be the second power or…

Piyush Choudhary: Yep.

Tyler Wright: we could talk about even moving that down the page a little bit depending on what folks here think and we can move become a provider to the second tile and then basically have this tile last my opinion is that deploy an application become a provider be second documentation should be third and then this should be fourth but That's just my thoughts.

Piyush Choudhary: So I think I can also update it.

Tyler Wright: Does anyone else have any?

Piyush Choudhary: It's not a big deal, but Yeah, I can do it now. It's

Tyler Wright: Okay, Zach Dennis. So you guys have any preference on the order of operations for these four tiles?

Denis Lelic: Nope, sounds good to me.

Zach Horn: Yeah, strong preference. I would say having deployed the first makes a lot of sense, but whatever needs to be done.

Piyush Choudhary: so yeah,…

Tyler Wright: Cool, how can we do?

Piyush Choudhary: so I'm just rewarding the things for the deployment applications by just keeping the cloud notes and I will just Change the order of the tiles under get started on the official domain right now and we'll continue working on the new website.

Tyler Wright: excellent

Denis Lelic: There's another item. I wanted to just quickly discuss piyush. If you could please just go to the Akash Web 2.0 figma file.

Piyush Choudhary: Yes, I want.

Denis Lelic: And if you go to the support page, it's bottom left.

Denis Lelic: yeah, I was just thinking about if we could implement. In the future, of course some sort of AI assistant so we could start with a question and it kind of provides different resources.

Denis Lelic: and below that we could just keep it simple direct users to GitHub issues Discord or discussions. But in general it would serve some sort of I don't know search engine / AI assistant.

Piyush Choudhary: just

Piyush Choudhary: yeah, I think it's definitely a good idea. We can integrate AI system and do this page where users will be able to ask any type of questions related to a cost also real time happenings as well integrated. We can also have a train version where the AI agent will be able to answer any type of technical proportions all the issues I think we already did this kind of thing with the Equus AI as well. I think if

Piyush Choudhary: there's some issues.

Piyush Choudhary: presentation So I think we already made it this kind of stuff where they got Tuesday is so we can just click that up to be integrated with.

Piyush Choudhary: presentation of selfish

Denis Lelic: what about I think we just mentioned it, but we haven't really discussed Akash console on the home page where we have that tile Dedicated for Akash console…

Piyush Choudhary: he

Denis Lelic: but now since we're like sun setting it we could replace that with some different tool.

00:30:00

Denis Lelic: I think it's best if you share the figment file.

Denis Lelic: and a home page right here.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, so we have a couple of tools listed here.

Piyush Choudhary: e

Denis Lelic: The main are Cloud nose and Prater. but we have additional space to Serve some others. Otherwise we could just remove them. And showcase only two. Yeah Zach.

Zach Horn: I'm just gonna throw out there that I would like to surface xdxl on Akash somewhere on the new website the thing that it does really well that it's already proving out is that it's a touch point that lets people like experience. What compute on Akash feels you can put in a prompt and it returns a finished image and four seconds. So we have all these apps that people can deploy which is obviously we should keep those top of mind and focused on the way they are but I don't know what this section would look like it could

Zach Horn: I could see it integrated into what you're looking at right now Denis or maybe in its own section that feels a little bit more. This would not be the copy but something like demos, that being the vibe of it where you come to the website. It's like let me just try it out real quick, and you can go to stxl on You can put in a prompt see the images being generated the other thing that it does. Excuse me. Is it serves now as a call to action for some of the things we're doing with Akasha Mel and tailored deployments with gpus the way it's set up with a call to action. So just a little bit, but I could see it either integrated into the section you're looking at now or in its own section that serves as easy to experience demo that then is also a call to action to reach out to us. an thoughts on that?

Denis Lelic: Yeah. Yeah,…

Tyler Wright: plus 1000

Denis Lelic: I'm just actually putting something together It could be kind of fairly simple.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Zach Horn: mmm

Denis Lelic: We could start what's possible and we just showcase. couple of I don't know it as the Excel confused, whatever we think.

Zach Horn: definitely

Denis Lelic: and that would be like what's possible? For now, I'll just put any just to have a reminder. What's this section about and

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Zach do you see it I'm just a simple call to action like being built right now and you click on it and you go directly to sdxl or do you see it goes to a case study page to show how Akash is being leveraged and then it goes sdxl. Do you think it's like you prefer to be one click so people can use right away, or do you want to have some supplemental information?

Zach Horn: I think yeah, if you're asking me for my Grand Vision, here's the Grand Vision is That it has a section the first step like…

Piyush Choudhary: 

Zach Horn: if we're doing order of operations, I would say the easiest to just have a direct right to xdx on This is some true Alpha, but if we're thinking down the line, I would say I would see it as a section on the website that surfaces the tool directly but then also has supporting information. So it's like case studies on how it was developed, it could be guides and content on how to prompt or how to use it. It could be, other adjacent content around how to develop on Akash more broadly and then a direct CTA on the website to reach out if you want to do something similar you're looking to deploy custom models or all that. That's obviously very down the line and there's a huge amount of work that we're doing right now. So I'd say the easiest first step is just link right to it people can click through and kind of poke around and figure it out for themselves. But if we were thinking down the line definitely a more built-out section that includes supporting content and possibly a direct call to action.

Tyler Wright: I love that. Yeah, I mean I think sdxl is the best case scenario. I would love to show I think this in kind of over the ecosystem page too, but website's deployed on akash, so the people can To your point just click on things and back. this is actually leveraging the Akash Network right now and…

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: just making mess around with the functionality, but I think sdxl and any other of those kind of AI.

Tyler Wright: Models are apps that you're working on would be great. I was actually just messing around with these a couple days ago And it's like in that same vein of it being a open source tool for another project.

00:35:00

Zach Horn: Yeah, definitely. I think As DXL is definitely a good one because it's running right now and it's performing and getting great usage come to you as another good one and that's potentially coming soon. definitely stay tuned for that. I'll add more info on that the next week or two, but What the dream is that eventually someone would come to the website they click through to these things. They get a sense of what's possible. but really what we want That at They see it deployed. there's a nice keyword tie-in with a 100s and then they go. I want to run XD Excel. But really what I want to do is run my own custom model, and then they click through on that call to action end up talking to somebody and we can get them deployed.

Piyush Choudhary: look up just

Zach Horn: With their own custom model. So yeah. Just reading your comment. Yeah, definitely.

Piyush Choudhary: and I also think Akash can also invest established in the Strategic partnership with the AI startups or even if some community members are building some AI related startups are fast and consider supporting them in turning them into a startup. So this can also have a great positive impact from the Holocaust system. even the investor will be able to see These are the startups that are in one Akash officially and Akash can have a strategic partnership with such kind of things instead of just keeping them limited to just a simple or just projects. So yeah, that's not

Zach Horn: Yeah, I love any touch point where we're showcasing other projects being built or leveraging Akash computer. I think that's always really strong for us and it's starting to get picked up by the mainstream we saw yeah, I'm sure you guys saw we had that feature in some before yesterday. But that was the focus of that piece is read the reporter went out and interviewed all these projects either Thumper and Foundry who are leveraging and caution various ways. And that was almost the focus of the story which I think is always very strong because it just shows people like choosing Akash from an entire Market of options.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I love that. I think the question I get asked the most I'm sure this is for everybody is how can I use Akash and

Tyler Wright: How much does it cost how much can I make by providing and I think that this new website revamp is going to do a much better job of answering both of those questions. So

Zach Horn: Yeah, I'll just jump in and say because you were showing it earlier. The pricing page views that you were showing that's I mean really amazing. I mean that's like something we needed forever. So I'm really excited to see that get built especially with real-time data. the ties Point like Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I'm gonna connect. website

Zach Horn: and nowhere is that's just the thing that People ask about all the time. how much does it cost for XYZ amount of compute. And then also if you're a provider how much can I make if I provide, x y z resources

Denis Lelic: Yeah, one thing here. We have to check with. Cloud nose but I try to ideate something for example what user would want but they don't want to go through all of this Hassle and Click and everything and set up these parameters and So what we could do is just have packages ready. So basic general purpose GPU optimized memory optimized so you can just click through and What would happen in the background? We would actually request bids and…

Piyush Choudhary: he

Denis Lelic: below this. We would somehow have to display bids.

Denis Lelic: maybe we could even pull that from console. But that's something we just have to To see if it's possible.

Tyler Wright: I think this is gonna be a team effort to be honest is something I would say that cloud most I know that their pricing tool is great. But it is incomplete. and I think cute Scott hewitson who's been just voying on. This call is going to be called into action for us to actually understand how some of these calculations are being derived and make sure that this makes sense, because one thing that we've seen is especially the provider side people have used Cloud those people have used a tool by a member of the community people use pray tour and they use those three different tools and put in the same information. They're going to get three separate answers that are not anywhere.

00:40:00

Tyler Wright: The don't even have the same methodology. So I think we need to work with Cloud most but also work with members in the core team. To figure out the calculation first and then we can optimize it.

Scott Hewitson: Yeah, I'm just on that point. I mean it's kind of like, if you ask hey how much money can I make having an Airbnb like being a host on Airbnb? it depends on the market depends on how big it is depends on so there is no one size fits all it's an Open Marketplace. Yeah, I don't know. I mean I think people have a hard time understanding that when it's like you go to other protocols and it's like okay, I put my minor up and I'm getting that fixed amount because that's what it is. It's a Marketplace. So that's all I gotta say.

Tyler Wright: yeah, I do I get what you're saying for sure, but there should be a little bit of a standardization or to denis' point. I think that's Scott's Caruthers of the part of a support tool. He built a while back had some sort of replication tool. So it was simulate deployments and see what kind of pricing it would get back and maybe again we can base it upon a real-time pricing, but I think everybody's a good point. I just want to make sure that we just take the time to really hone in on how pricing is being calculated.

Piyush Choudhary: Really?

Zach Horn: That's it. I'll just jump in quickly to say that if there's a way that we can pull deployment pricing in some way that we're just showcasing it on the website. that would be great. Because to Huey's Point. Yeah, there's unlimited optionality that influences what the pricing might be. But if you think about the Airbnb example the way you would get a sense of what you could earn with an airbnbs. You probably look for comparables. So if we could figure out a way to Showcase that of let's just choose Nvidia 100. the dream would be that you go to the website. Excuse me. I'm on week four of this cold. So I'm still getting over a cough, but the

Zach Horn: You go to the website you could filter in some way by a 100s and then see what the current pricing on the network is that would be the dream. I mean that's quite complicated because you'd have to pull live pricing or simulate a bit to ties point on what Scott Carothers was working on but If there's a way to do that, that would be extremely valuable in my opinion.

Scott Hewitson: Plus 50 to that.

Piyush Choudhary: So yeah, I think we have three. Dynamic things that you can Implement on the official website and it's the price compare when he's Akash and when it's a providers. so I just want all the 14 numbers to provide us with the

Piyush Choudhary: apis and points all the directions all the guidance to pets all this details properly and from where to fetch 30 days as soon as we get the UK and points or the proper guidance from the sources where we can get the data which It will be much easier forest and return the official website that you're saying right now you're staying

Tyler Wright: Okay, that may take a week or so maybe even longer. I guess the different point if we talk about even provider because I just saw you show provider screen. One thing that we're still trying to find tune is.

Tyler Wright: Pray tour and cloudmose have different statistics on provider. I know that they're taking him a different cadences and over different periods is too, but I just want to make sure That you had the most up-to-date data and then hopefully it could standardize it across those Partners so that everybody's kind of feeding the same data whether it's on Akash Network Cloud, no sort.

Piyush Choudhary: So this is the tool that we made for the cost of account.

Tyler Wright: Play tour.

00:45:00

Piyush Choudhary: So I think we can pick this To have an EA assistant on the support page. So we're working on it very soon and also be proposed this Akash deploy tool. To the discussions where you just have to put in the GitHub username guitar producer and password username Docker people stadium and just click on generator still want this tool does this it just pulls out the code created open image push the docker image The Hub here the perfectness required. We all have the option to say my budget is I need this in this operating system. and in just one UI you can have Looks like they still so it's in early stage that we've submitted in that con. so

Piyush Choudhary: yeah, this area system can be customized integrated on the support page of the Cross. So I will look into it.

Tyler Wright: excellent All…

Denis Lelic: Sounds good.

Tyler Wright: Now we started a little bit late, but we're coming up on time. Is there anything else Dennis that you wanted to cover Zach or anything else that anybody else want to talk about before? We drop off.

Denis Lelic: No for me. Some action items for next week. I want to explore the Showcase part Zach just having a showcase and case studies and so on. I'm just wondering is that part of the ecosystem or it's a thing on its own? the next action item. Would be homepage and the hero section Tyler mentioned.

Denis Lelic: I'm just wondering what can I do to help around the pricing page? Yeah, it's Tyler mentioned. We probably have to involve Max's Scott.

Denis Lelic: It's a tricky one, but I'll keep it in my mind. So.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: My talk is either have a working group session that's specifically about pricing or wait till this again analytics meeting and talk about it there. But again, I want to get this done in a week to 10 days to try to figure out because this is a lingering problem and I think now we have A reason to talk about it a little bit more specifically and no figure it out.

Denis Lelic: cool

Emmanuel Arthur: Hey page, so. Are you going to work on the issue that Tyler has raised on the top as well as the Detroit?

Piyush Choudhary: Yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: so yeah, what you can do is you can work on this Detroit page, So this deployed page. Needs to be worked back to just proudmose. And of course Council needs to be moved. If you can complete this by tomorrow, then you can also just change the tiles it will. This week lines support or else if not tomorrow, then I will just change it within tomorrow.

Emmanuel Arthur: Okay.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, me and Arthur actually talked very shortly about this page that we're seeing now. Unfortunately, he doesn't have access to the code.

Denis Lelic: He has done previously where we had educated page for each of these products also in cloudmouse. So Arthur mentioned he would have to build it again from scratch just for clone of

Emmanuel Arthur: Yes, yes regarding that page. What I did was when I was implemented this page arm. I deleted everything then rewrite the quote again. And when you check the page, you could see that at the right side the new design that Denis had time for the cloud most Beach you could see that there will be some slider. Implementing that would be a huge challenge. So in fact of the time giving I think if I'm able to work on it. It's going to be like maybe tomorrow evening 8pm you and make it PR on it. Yeah, because I need to make sure that that's like that will fit on all screens. Yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: Yeah, No.

Denis Lelic: If the slider is a big issue for you, maybe we can just focus on. removing console and

00:50:00

Denis Lelic: just having the cloud nose page there and later on in an extra PR you could create the slider if you wish.

Emmanuel Arthur: Okay.

Denis Lelic: You mean the gallery slider, right?

Emmanuel Arthur: Yes, yes. Yes.

Denis Lelic: Okay.

Denis Lelic: One sec.

Emmanuel Arthur: But in the teamstone needed to get it done I can work on it, but it's going to take a couple of hours to face it but I got still work on it though.

Tyler Wright: Thank you I know Arthur this is a higher priority because console has been deprecated. We just want to make sure that people are going to Cloud most and not to try to use console which is not optimized from a user experience standpoint right now.

Emmanuel Arthur: 

Denis Lelic: Okay, anything else we should mention before we wrap it up?

Piyush Choudhary: So I have one I was like,…

Tyler Wright: I think Im

Piyush Choudhary: I know we call ten days I think will be in good position to make this new website. what should they steering committee meeting? I'll just make the changes. accordingly within this Indus 10 days and then we can make the new website officially provides I think and then with pricing things takes time, we can still make the website live and If there endpoints all the ways to punch the real-time data, we can Implement that later on as well.

Denis Lelic: Sounds good.

Tyler Wright: That sounds good to me. we'll talk a little bit next week.

Piyush Choudhary: or else yeah.

Tyler Wright: We'll talk a little bit next week after the steering committee about next steps and taking a live strategy, just want to make sure all the links are working. We do have to think about current links that Zach has been putting on Twitter and making sure that we're not just setting ourselves up to have a bunch of broken links. So I think there's a little bit of leg work. We at least have to think about my strategy standpoint, but we'll focus on that next week.

Piyush Choudhary: It shows we can always give a time for the final touches. but I'll try to make sure that the possible we have the pricing and points Etc. So it will look much better. We can implement this.

Denis Lelic: cool

Piyush Choudhary: So I think the direction is pretty solid so far. We are directions that can someone base. cost as well as smooth and we will continue doing the same and hopefully if not 10 days within next to the weeks, the new website will be like we show you on the official

Tyler Wright: amazing

Piyush Choudhary: Also I forgot you guys have time.

Denis Lelic: our piyush if anyone else has Time they can stay in this call. Otherwise if have Did you want to share something else?

Piyush Choudhary: If so, I just want to say that I got the access to the new docs. But we have to implement a dog space from scratch because the new design has been Contributes including the getting started page, but there is a content for doing the docs. So I just want you guys to take a look at the content that it's been done in the dark's new docs orders or code base. So we're doing cementing that content. So if it is incomplete, just We will not do that. It's complete. just inform us so we can Implement that content as it is and

Denis Lelic: Okay, cool.

Tyler Wright: Right. Yeah piyush. Can you throw that message and the Akash website working group channel, so I'll just make sure I'm clear because I might want to make sure that Scott is included on that conversation. So just throw anything related to the docs in working group of class website and then we can talk about async.

Piyush Choudhary: Sure, always.

Tyler Wright: All right, if there's nothing else and again, we can just drop off here. Some of us will be in contact with you shortly.

Meeting ended after 00:55:51 👋

Denis Lelic: Welcome everybody to today's working group meeting for Akash website. I hope you're all doing well. so these meetings happen every week on Thursday. I'm not sure it's What Pacific time is that Tyler? Sorry?

Tyler Wright: You're fine. It's Eastern Time. 6:30 AM Pacific.

Denis Lelic: Okay, sounds good. So yeah. Maybe we just kick it off and start with the latest of the updates from piyush and his team they've been working on the website revamp for the last couple of weeks. And basically every week we have a look at the progress they made. Later on, we're answering questions. Make sure there's no blockers and we keep this thing moving and progressing. A H they have anything to share.

Denis Lelic: Any updates from last week?

Piyush Choudhary: if I'm sharing with

Denis Lelic: Thanks.

Piyush Choudhary: Is my screen visible?

Piyush Choudhary: So I've dropped the link to see it live on your sleep you can check out this link that have talked in the chat Suite Life. So mostly we are almost done with the foundational structure. We have almost worked on all the pages but after discussions with  Dennis today privately, so there are some weeks that will be made the design and also the content that has been decided and also I would ask all the quality numbers to talk to the content of all the pages including development community and about sages. So if you look at the overview of the website We have the home page. We have the blog page. We have getting started page. But this getting started page would be moved to the docs as per this plan. So.

Piyush Choudhary: So they're talking about it later. I've seen discussions and then we have the token page ecosystem page about page lesson branding page across Community page and lastly development page and it comes to the content right? So we have three About page development page and Akash Community page that contains the general contents. And then lastly we have the dogs which contains the overall structure or guidance tutorials or whatever, So if we look at the development page, right, so this is the development page right on the left hand side in the files.

Piyush Choudhary: Or the content files that we can change and the content will appear here and on this page, but after seeing the recent designs, so we'll be taking it a little bit only this part will remain here and on this space section will be removed and the content will be expended because after being somebody search as I can see in the designs done by many. if we talk about the content of and so these things

Piyush Choudhary: So this list of projects it has five columns if we keep the only space section which is designed by us. Then it will make Things look very compressed and it will not be good. So for three pages development community so these three pages are not kind of tutorial but be basically a kind of location the general details about what's happening because the recent development proposal is a job. So we'll be removing this section and will be extending this middle content to the whole page. here incidentally

Denis Lelic: Yeah, Regarding this menu on the right side. It's called on this page. I think that's something we're just inherited from the previous page and who go template.

Denis Lelic: So my suggestion would be like to kick it out if in case we don't need it. That's something that's often used in the docs.

00:05:00

Piyush Choudhary: reading this

Denis Lelic: but If the content is shorter, there's not So Much Information going on and I think there is no need for that and we could expand the main content. and just there's gonna be much more real estate for the main content and the focus of users could be centered around the main content

Piyush Choudhary: yeah, it shows so.

Piyush Choudhary: so there are three pages basically in the whole website related to subscribe so that would be Affected by the state one is a development which as you can see one is a community contributions with and when it's about page for this key pages will be affected and this on this space sections will be out and on this space actually will be kept in the docks because it's usually captained at all because we have the bigger contents and on this space section such as the navigate to the full contents, so we will just take it out and well as for the middle text will be expand into the right completely on the left part of the cap as it is that you are seeing on the screen.

Piyush Choudhary: this is the homepage that you are looking so we have get started page and get started H. We have two pages to plan applications to become a provider. And this all will also be kicked out and customize your account should experience in the product and people start from here this stage. So we implemented only the cloud notes because Council console support has been discontinued from nonverbs. So this is what the get started which looks like but later as for the new designs the get started page will be made to be a part of a cost talks because documentation still have the home page. I sell the direction by Denis. So this on page helps us is the overview of stocks and accordingly. We will Implement our cost documentation as well.

Piyush Choudhary: And this is all about get started page. I think it has all been discussed in the past. So there's not much but there are some changes that will be made to the homepage. For example. We talk about joined the terminating so these thoughts so we have two options to make this cards Dynamic one. We subscribes to the Twitter API which costs around thousand USD per month and then implement the API endpoints will be displayed in your time. we can just have the markdown file we bear we just have to Keep on updating only three to four details, for example. the content of the text the username and the image so this three things will be

Piyush Choudhary: updated in the markdown file and we can call it instead of following pictures. Let's say someone tweaked a good thing or let's say we want to show the Weight on this page, right? We can just implemented with text into the modern file into the display here like this as you see or if we want to keep things Dynamic then we can subscribe.

Piyush Choudhary: So this is the homepage they were saying on the screen and we have the development page. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I know there's some hands up but my vote is certainly for the markdown file approach because I don't think those testimonials are. that big of action but I saw that Arthur had his hand up and then Dennis.

Piyush Choudhary: Okay.

Emmanuel Arthur: Can you guys hear me?

Emmanuel Arthur: Yeah, I want to ask why we have so many. Menu items at the now back. Thank you guys do something about it.

Piyush Choudhary: Yeah, so I will have a chat with the in to minimize the things because I also personally feel like we are having a lot of menu items in the network, but I always get the direction because the pages has been increased the same place. So I always get the direction to keep things.

Emmanuel Arthur: Maybe a drop down will help.

00:10:00

Piyush Choudhary: I think we can combine you menu items or…

Emmanuel Arthur: Keep them.

Piyush Choudhary: cities and can have a drop-down for example. Let's say development community so these three pages are mostly related to each other so we can have a single headline here. And when we go over it the development community and about section drops down. Or we can keep it like this as well.

Emmanuel Arthur: 

Piyush Choudhary: This. and it's yeah you

Denis Lelic: Regarding the menu items. Previously, I don't know why maybe it was because of restrictions from that Hugo template we use but I know Greg was avoiding any dropdowns. He wanted Direct. links to the pages so we kind of Kept that idea and…

Piyush Choudhary: he

Denis Lelic: just keep on adding new items up there. But if We have a good argument that not working. It's getting clustered and overcrowded. We can always say here's the solution we discussed that here are the problem. And so on and yeah, we can do something about it for sure and regarding a couple of other things piyush mentioned just to provide some.

Denis Lelic: clarification around it a while ago I have no idea when that happened, but Luna was also part of this calls and I was also a discussion and working group for Akash documentation where we discussed to get started page around in the Akash Docs. but it took some time to

Denis Lelic: Develop and bring those dogs into the website. that's why we kind of just a get started page. Before we brought docs page into the website, but now since we have piyush here and his team and they're working on to bring the dogs. And the website together, so we have this experience in. One website we could get started page into the Akash Docs.

Piyush Choudhary: he

Denis Lelic: and it would provide

Denis Lelic: one Hub of information. So anyone who's trying to get started will be served with additional items are in the menu bar. on the left or for example, if you click deploy an application you'll be presented with a page with Cloud nose, but again, we can list additional deployment resources at the bottom and it's going to link to the

Denis Lelic: Same environment meaning it's gonna stay in the doc's page. so that's something I Changed in the last week. of course. We haven't discussed this until now so I just provided some context context around it for Zach Taylor and…

Piyush Choudhary: You right.

Denis Lelic: Arthur and emph was just talking this morning. About it. So if you have any comments any suggestions like I Arthur please let us know we can always Change or adapt the direction.

Denis Lelic: and one additional thing would be

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: yeah on the homepage. We had couple of tools to get you started. And a couple of templates listed there. But now we have one space available for consoles and to replace the console. So I was just thinking about what kind of tool or app we could place here. Yeah Thai

Tyler Wright: A couple cool question. I just threw something this is related to the homepage. So I don't want to cut off what you're talking about with the model section, but on the banner. And this is just an open discussion on the banner section. I just threw a link in the chat that an article came out that features Akash Network and in these Banner image shots, it shows basically I think the header Banner for all the various website. I feel compared to some of the other folks in the space. Our better Banner is a little bit text heavy versus having text and some imagery or maybe some background imagery. I just wanted to open that up to discussion very briefly to see if anybody else had any thoughts comments.

00:15:00

Tyler Wright: questions or Should we just keep it as is and…

Denis Lelic: Are you talking about the hero section with the headline?

Tyler Wright: just continue to move forward?

Tyler Wright: Yeah exactly. I'm not saying that headline should go but I wonder if we want to add any sort of accompanying visual assets that maybe show a decentralized network or some more like Hardware or something, that maybe the increases the storytelling or maybe it's not necessary. I just want to open it up to the group for discussion.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I'm totally for it. I think this direction we have at the moment is something again. We inherit it from the previous website. So I think everyone was just trying to be respectful of the previous website and the direction and Greg has set ups so Yeah, just with the dropdowns we can say. Here's an idea. And this is why we think it's It was part of this discussion in this working group, and we can also provide examples how other projects

Denis Lelic: hero section looks like and when it's listed together, for example, in the link you've provided we can say Hey, we're kind of lacking. We need to step up our game.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I'm just gonna add that an action item. for the next week that maybe explore what can be done here and Maybe explore what are the trends at the moment what other projects are doing and so on so on?

Piyush Choudhary: So I think we are in good pets. So I'm just giving our view again.

Piyush Choudhary: So we have the homepage then we have superstars that are ready for maintain about which contains the general contain contents. Whatever is meeting such a talk, and then we have the tops that will be kind of percent of the tutorials or Royal. And then we have the ecosystem page which has already been done. And the good thing is everything is coming from the maldon files. So even a non-technical person should be able to implement the new projects at the new projects as well. And lastly we have to open page and doesn't page metrics will be patched from the cloud most apis. Just so that in the new design file there is pricings and some guidelines for example

Denis Lelic: It might be looking at network activity. It's part of the development.

Piyush Choudhary: we have so yes.

Denis Lelic: Yeah. there's some data we could pull from cloud nose. especially around network activity

Piyush Choudhary: so there are three pages that we need data from the cloud nose providers when it's pricing calculators one is analytics. So I asked for the API and points all the way to fetch the data from all these three pages in your time. So in the Discord the chat of cloud mods already. So once that is provided will be able to implement that on the cash website as well. So we will kind of have a details on the cloud most website as it is and we will also have the details on the official website as well. for example, if I go to about section when I click on the pricing? this presentation will be dynamic and you just be able to scroll up down and presentation expected guys, but

00:20:00

Piyush Choudhary: We need to have some kind of detail salts some guidance. Although I found they play but there are some Arrow sign getting I just need a little guidance from the problem or stream on how to catch the real-time data from the

Denis Lelic: Yeah, there's one thing.

Denis Lelic: Tyler mentioned a couple of minutes ago. This price needs to be in the navbar. we could move that and just keep it in the photo section. I'm not really sure how much traffic we get on. discussions

Denis Lelic: because we already have the GitHub button over there.

Piyush Choudhary: 

Piyush Choudhary: and I think we can remove this from the navbar as well discussions.

Denis Lelic: But we do mention discussions in the homepage right away. when we have a call to action join the community and then we have a couple of testimonials there above that.

Piyush Choudhary: when

Denis Lelic: There's GitHub discussions I think in your button you're just missing discussions inside so

Piyush Choudhary: If so, yeah, I will demand the discussion with them.

Denis Lelic: So we could reduce the amount of items in the navbar just kicking out. press

Tyler Wright: Real quick on the back of the homepage real fast. just I know that I get the steering committee has been moved to next Wednesday as a part of the steering committee. I was hoping that piyush I think you already talked about this is going to give a short demo of the progress for the website. I think everyone will be excited to see ahead of that. I would just love and I know this is low priority right now, but ahead of that meeting. I know that we made some adjustments to the current website to adjust the language from access gpus to reach out. I would love to keep that consistent so that it doesn't become a point of distraction, turn that demo.

Piyush Choudhary: yeah, sure. Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, maybe you just have a look at the sigma file. I've updated it there.

Piyush Choudhary: if I

Denis Lelic: So we have deploy now and additional button to reach out.

Piyush Choudhary: I serve. So yeah,…

Denis Lelic: yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: By first number I think I'll be able to update these days as well by keeping out on this way sections. And yeah, I think by first talk no, but they will be more progress and fixes Final Fix so I think there is one item that we can assign to.

Piyush Choudhary: Arthur if you guys don't know

Denis Lelic: Which one?

Piyush Choudhary: this page moving back to the previous version because I think he implemented the code so it will be possible for him to move back this base to the previous version.

Emmanuel Arthur: up yeah, I would like to work on this and

Piyush Choudhary: 

Tyler Wright: Share with that at all. So is that one of the open issues that we talked about a couple days ago that we would just want to hand over to?

Piyush Choudhary: Yes.

Tyler Wright: Let's see. I know assistant change. The order has happened done. Let me just

Tyler Wright: Sorry, I'm talking a lot. So we have a couple of issues. I think one's closed but we have This issue that was opened a couple days ago by myself here. She did something that you also want Arthur to handle. the order of the section that get started as well as that main page.

Piyush Choudhary: So we definition.

Denis Lelic: It's just reversing the order. So we start with deploying.

Piyush Choudhary: Yeah, so basically only there is a change on this deployed page so right now is we can see we have two sections apart on soil and…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: crowd most we just want to keep the clock Mouse on this page as well the directions so I think that instant Denis…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: then just share the pigma political also for this page and also can just reward the code base and the implement the previous versions as for what it usually

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I think that's clear I guess additionally. have you already implemented the saw for issue 279 or is that something you also want Arthur to do?

00:25:00

Piyush Choudhary: With chemical means I didn't check they should presentation.

Tyler Wright: yeah, no problem.

Piyush Choudhary: That's myself.

Piyush Choudhary: can you tell what it is related to? Is it opened recently?

Denis Lelic: It's part of this.

Tyler Wright: Yes. Then you could…

Denis Lelic: Yeah, go ahead.

Piyush Choudhary: I think

Tyler Wright: if you can move up to page a little bit to get started if you can click on the get started tab piyush.

Piyush Choudhary: we have

Tyler Wright: perfect on this page the leftmost tile is access high performance gpus Basically,…

Piyush Choudhary: yeah.

Tyler Wright: the direction is we want to switch these tiles. So the deployed application should be the first tile that you see and then the access high performance GPU should be the second power or…

Piyush Choudhary: Yep.

Tyler Wright: we could talk about even moving that down the page a little bit depending on what folks here think and we can move become a provider to the second tile and then basically have this tile last my opinion is that deploy an application become a provider be second documentation should be third and then this should be fourth but That's just my thoughts.

Piyush Choudhary: So I think I can also update it.

Tyler Wright: Does anyone else have any?

Piyush Choudhary: It's not a big deal, but Yeah, I can do it now. It's

Tyler Wright: Okay, Zach Dennis. So you guys have any preference on the order of operations for these four tiles?

Denis Lelic: Nope, sounds good to me.

Zach Horn: Yeah, strong preference. I would say having deployed the first makes a lot of sense, but whatever needs to be done.

Piyush Choudhary: so yeah,…

Tyler Wright: Cool, how can we do?

Piyush Choudhary: so I'm just rewarding the things for the deployment applications by just keeping the cloud notes and I will just Change the order of the tiles under get started on the official domain right now and we'll continue working on the new website.

Tyler Wright: excellent

Denis Lelic: There's another item. I wanted to just quickly discuss piyush. If you could please just go to the Akash Web 2.0 figma file.

Piyush Choudhary: Yes, I want.

Denis Lelic: And if you go to the support page, it's bottom left.

Denis Lelic: yeah, I was just thinking about if we could implement. In the future, of course some sort of AI assistant so we could start with a question and it kind of provides different resources.

Denis Lelic: and below that we could just keep it simple direct users to GitHub issues Discord or discussions. But in general it would serve some sort of I don't know search engine / AI assistant.

Piyush Choudhary: just

Piyush Choudhary: yeah, I think it's definitely a good idea. We can integrate AI system and do this page where users will be able to ask any type of questions related to a cost also real time happenings as well integrated. We can also have a train version where the AI agent will be able to answer any type of technical proportions all the issues I think we already did this kind of thing with the Equus AI as well. I think if

Piyush Choudhary: there's some issues.

Piyush Choudhary: presentation So I think we already made it this kind of stuff where they got Tuesday is so we can just click that up to be integrated with.

Piyush Choudhary: presentation of selfish

Denis Lelic: what about I think we just mentioned it, but we haven't really discussed Akash console on the home page where we have that tile Dedicated for Akash console…

Piyush Choudhary: he

Denis Lelic: but now since we're like sun setting it we could replace that with some different tool.

00:30:00

Denis Lelic: I think it's best if you share the figment file.

Denis Lelic: and a home page right here.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, so we have a couple of tools listed here.

Piyush Choudhary: e

Denis Lelic: The main are Cloud nose and Prater. but we have additional space to Serve some others. Otherwise we could just remove them. And showcase only two. Yeah Zach.

Zach Horn: I'm just gonna throw out there that I would like to surface xdxl on Akash somewhere on the new website the thing that it does really well that it's already proving out is that it's a touch point that lets people like experience. What compute on Akash feels you can put in a prompt and it returns a finished image and four seconds. So we have all these apps that people can deploy which is obviously we should keep those top of mind and focused on the way they are but I don't know what this section would look like it could

Zach Horn: I could see it integrated into what you're looking at right now Denis or maybe in its own section that feels a little bit more. This would not be the copy but something like demos, that being the vibe of it where you come to the website. It's like let me just try it out real quick, and you can go to stxl on You can put in a prompt see the images being generated the other thing that it does. Excuse me. Is it serves now as a call to action for some of the things we're doing with Akasha Mel and tailored deployments with gpus the way it's set up with a call to action. So just a little bit, but I could see it either integrated into the section you're looking at now or in its own section that serves as easy to experience demo that then is also a call to action to reach out to us. an thoughts on that?

Denis Lelic: Yeah. Yeah,…

Tyler Wright: plus 1000

Denis Lelic: I'm just actually putting something together It could be kind of fairly simple.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Zach Horn: mmm

Denis Lelic: We could start what's possible and we just showcase. couple of I don't know it as the Excel confused, whatever we think.

Zach Horn: definitely

Denis Lelic: and that would be like what's possible? For now, I'll just put any just to have a reminder. What's this section about and

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Zach do you see it I'm just a simple call to action like being built right now and you click on it and you go directly to sdxl or do you see it goes to a case study page to show how Akash is being leveraged and then it goes sdxl. Do you think it's like you prefer to be one click so people can use right away, or do you want to have some supplemental information?

Zach Horn: I think yeah, if you're asking me for my Grand Vision, here's the Grand Vision is That it has a section the first step like…

Piyush Choudhary: 

Zach Horn: if we're doing order of operations, I would say the easiest to just have a direct right to xdx on This is some true Alpha, but if we're thinking down the line, I would say I would see it as a section on the website that surfaces the tool directly but then also has supporting information. So it's like case studies on how it was developed, it could be guides and content on how to prompt or how to use it. It could be, other adjacent content around how to develop on Akash more broadly and then a direct CTA on the website to reach out if you want to do something similar you're looking to deploy custom models or all that. That's obviously very down the line and there's a huge amount of work that we're doing right now. So I'd say the easiest first step is just link right to it people can click through and kind of poke around and figure it out for themselves. But if we were thinking down the line definitely a more built-out section that includes supporting content and possibly a direct call to action.

Tyler Wright: I love that. Yeah, I mean I think sdxl is the best case scenario. I would love to show I think this in kind of over the ecosystem page too, but website's deployed on akash, so the people can To your point just click on things and back. this is actually leveraging the Akash Network right now and…

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: just making mess around with the functionality, but I think sdxl and any other of those kind of AI.

Tyler Wright: Models are apps that you're working on would be great. I was actually just messing around with these a couple days ago And it's like in that same vein of it being a open source tool for another project.

00:35:00

Zach Horn: Yeah, definitely. I think As DXL is definitely a good one because it's running right now and it's performing and getting great usage come to you as another good one and that's potentially coming soon. definitely stay tuned for that. I'll add more info on that the next week or two, but What the dream is that eventually someone would come to the website they click through to these things. They get a sense of what's possible. but really what we want That at They see it deployed. there's a nice keyword tie-in with a 100s and then they go. I want to run XD Excel. But really what I want to do is run my own custom model, and then they click through on that call to action end up talking to somebody and we can get them deployed.

Piyush Choudhary: look up just

Zach Horn: With their own custom model. So yeah. Just reading your comment. Yeah, definitely.

Piyush Choudhary: and I also think Akash can also invest established in the Strategic partnership with the AI startups or even if some community members are building some AI related startups are fast and consider supporting them in turning them into a startup. So this can also have a great positive impact from the Holocaust system. even the investor will be able to see These are the startups that are in one Akash officially and Akash can have a strategic partnership with such kind of things instead of just keeping them limited to just a simple or just projects. So yeah, that's not

Zach Horn: Yeah, I love any touch point where we're showcasing other projects being built or leveraging Akash computer. I think that's always really strong for us and it's starting to get picked up by the mainstream we saw yeah, I'm sure you guys saw we had that feature in some before yesterday. But that was the focus of that piece is read the reporter went out and interviewed all these projects either Thumper and Foundry who are leveraging and caution various ways. And that was almost the focus of the story which I think is always very strong because it just shows people like choosing Akash from an entire Market of options.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I love that. I think the question I get asked the most I'm sure this is for everybody is how can I use Akash and

Tyler Wright: How much does it cost how much can I make by providing and I think that this new website revamp is going to do a much better job of answering both of those questions. So

Zach Horn: Yeah, I'll just jump in and say because you were showing it earlier. The pricing page views that you were showing that's I mean really amazing. I mean that's like something we needed forever. So I'm really excited to see that get built especially with real-time data. the ties Point like Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I'm gonna connect. website

Zach Horn: and nowhere is that's just the thing that People ask about all the time. how much does it cost for XYZ amount of compute. And then also if you're a provider how much can I make if I provide, x y z resources

Denis Lelic: Yeah, one thing here. We have to check with. Cloud nose but I try to ideate something for example what user would want but they don't want to go through all of this Hassle and Click and everything and set up these parameters and So what we could do is just have packages ready. So basic general purpose GPU optimized memory optimized so you can just click through and What would happen in the background? We would actually request bids and…

Piyush Choudhary: he

Denis Lelic: below this. We would somehow have to display bids.

Denis Lelic: maybe we could even pull that from console. But that's something we just have to To see if it's possible.

Tyler Wright: I think this is gonna be a team effort to be honest is something I would say that cloud most I know that their pricing tool is great. But it is incomplete. and I think cute Scott hewitson who's been just voying on. This call is going to be called into action for us to actually understand how some of these calculations are being derived and make sure that this makes sense, because one thing that we've seen is especially the provider side people have used Cloud those people have used a tool by a member of the community people use pray tour and they use those three different tools and put in the same information. They're going to get three separate answers that are not anywhere.

00:40:00

Tyler Wright: The don't even have the same methodology. So I think we need to work with Cloud most but also work with members in the core team. To figure out the calculation first and then we can optimize it.

Scott Hewitson: Yeah, I'm just on that point. I mean it's kind of like, if you ask hey how much money can I make having an Airbnb like being a host on Airbnb? it depends on the market depends on how big it is depends on so there is no one size fits all it's an Open Marketplace. Yeah, I don't know. I mean I think people have a hard time understanding that when it's like you go to other protocols and it's like okay, I put my minor up and I'm getting that fixed amount because that's what it is. It's a Marketplace. So that's all I gotta say.

Tyler Wright: yeah, I do I get what you're saying for sure, but there should be a little bit of a standardization or to denis' point. I think that's Scott's Caruthers of the part of a support tool. He built a while back had some sort of replication tool. So it was simulate deployments and see what kind of pricing it would get back and maybe again we can base it upon a real-time pricing, but I think everybody's a good point. I just want to make sure that we just take the time to really hone in on how pricing is being calculated.

Piyush Choudhary: Really?

Zach Horn: That's it. I'll just jump in quickly to say that if there's a way that we can pull deployment pricing in some way that we're just showcasing it on the website. that would be great. Because to Huey's Point. Yeah, there's unlimited optionality that influences what the pricing might be. But if you think about the Airbnb example the way you would get a sense of what you could earn with an airbnbs. You probably look for comparables. So if we could figure out a way to Showcase that of let's just choose Nvidia 100. the dream would be that you go to the website. Excuse me. I'm on week four of this cold. So I'm still getting over a cough, but the

Zach Horn: You go to the website you could filter in some way by a 100s and then see what the current pricing on the network is that would be the dream. I mean that's quite complicated because you'd have to pull live pricing or simulate a bit to ties point on what Scott Carothers was working on but If there's a way to do that, that would be extremely valuable in my opinion.

Scott Hewitson: Plus 50 to that.

Piyush Choudhary: So yeah, I think we have three. Dynamic things that you can Implement on the official website and it's the price compare when he's Akash and when it's a providers. so I just want all the 14 numbers to provide us with the

Piyush Choudhary: apis and points all the directions all the guidance to pets all this details properly and from where to fetch 30 days as soon as we get the UK and points or the proper guidance from the sources where we can get the data which It will be much easier forest and return the official website that you're saying right now you're staying

Tyler Wright: Okay, that may take a week or so maybe even longer. I guess the different point if we talk about even provider because I just saw you show provider screen. One thing that we're still trying to find tune is.

Tyler Wright: Pray tour and cloudmose have different statistics on provider. I know that they're taking him a different cadences and over different periods is too, but I just want to make sure That you had the most up-to-date data and then hopefully it could standardize it across those Partners so that everybody's kind of feeding the same data whether it's on Akash Network Cloud, no sort.

Piyush Choudhary: So this is the tool that we made for the cost of account.

Tyler Wright: Play tour.

00:45:00

Piyush Choudhary: So I think we can pick this To have an EA assistant on the support page. So we're working on it very soon and also be proposed this Akash deploy tool. To the discussions where you just have to put in the GitHub username guitar producer and password username Docker people stadium and just click on generator still want this tool does this it just pulls out the code created open image push the docker image The Hub here the perfectness required. We all have the option to say my budget is I need this in this operating system. and in just one UI you can have Looks like they still so it's in early stage that we've submitted in that con. so

Piyush Choudhary: yeah, this area system can be customized integrated on the support page of the Cross. So I will look into it.

Tyler Wright: excellent All…

Denis Lelic: Sounds good.

Tyler Wright: Now we started a little bit late, but we're coming up on time. Is there anything else Dennis that you wanted to cover Zach or anything else that anybody else want to talk about before? We drop off.

Denis Lelic: No for me. Some action items for next week. I want to explore the Showcase part Zach just having a showcase and case studies and so on. I'm just wondering is that part of the ecosystem or it's a thing on its own? the next action item. Would be homepage and the hero section Tyler mentioned.

Denis Lelic: I'm just wondering what can I do to help around the pricing page? Yeah, it's Tyler mentioned. We probably have to involve Max's Scott.

Denis Lelic: It's a tricky one, but I'll keep it in my mind. So.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: My talk is either have a working group session that's specifically about pricing or wait till this again analytics meeting and talk about it there. But again, I want to get this done in a week to 10 days to try to figure out because this is a lingering problem and I think now we have A reason to talk about it a little bit more specifically and no figure it out.

Denis Lelic: cool

Emmanuel Arthur: Hey page, so. Are you going to work on the issue that Tyler has raised on the top as well as the Detroit?

Piyush Choudhary: Yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: so yeah, what you can do is you can work on this Detroit page, So this deployed page. Needs to be worked back to just proudmose. And of course Council needs to be moved. If you can complete this by tomorrow, then you can also just change the tiles it will. This week lines support or else if not tomorrow, then I will just change it within tomorrow.

Emmanuel Arthur: Okay.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, me and Arthur actually talked very shortly about this page that we're seeing now. Unfortunately, he doesn't have access to the code.

Denis Lelic: He has done previously where we had educated page for each of these products also in cloudmouse. So Arthur mentioned he would have to build it again from scratch just for clone of

Emmanuel Arthur: Yes, yes regarding that page. What I did was when I was implemented this page arm. I deleted everything then rewrite the quote again. And when you check the page, you could see that at the right side the new design that Denis had time for the cloud most Beach you could see that there will be some slider. Implementing that would be a huge challenge. So in fact of the time giving I think if I'm able to work on it. It's going to be like maybe tomorrow evening 8pm you and make it PR on it. Yeah, because I need to make sure that that's like that will fit on all screens. Yeah.

Piyush Choudhary: Yeah, No.

Denis Lelic: If the slider is a big issue for you, maybe we can just focus on. removing console and

00:50:00

Denis Lelic: just having the cloud nose page there and later on in an extra PR you could create the slider if you wish.

Emmanuel Arthur: Okay.

Denis Lelic: You mean the gallery slider, right?

Emmanuel Arthur: Yes, yes. Yes.

Denis Lelic: Okay.

Denis Lelic: One sec.

Emmanuel Arthur: But in the teamstone needed to get it done I can work on it, but it's going to take a couple of hours to face it but I got still work on it though.

Tyler Wright: Thank you I know Arthur this is a higher priority because console has been deprecated. We just want to make sure that people are going to Cloud most and not to try to use console which is not optimized from a user experience standpoint right now.

Emmanuel Arthur: 

Denis Lelic: Okay, anything else we should mention before we wrap it up?

Piyush Choudhary: So I have one I was like,…

Tyler Wright: I think Im

Piyush Choudhary: I know we call ten days I think will be in good position to make this new website. what should they steering committee meeting? I'll just make the changes. accordingly within this Indus 10 days and then we can make the new website officially provides I think and then with pricing things takes time, we can still make the website live and If there endpoints all the ways to punch the real-time data, we can Implement that later on as well.

Denis Lelic: Sounds good.

Tyler Wright: That sounds good to me. we'll talk a little bit next week.

Piyush Choudhary: or else yeah.

Tyler Wright: We'll talk a little bit next week after the steering committee about next steps and taking a live strategy, just want to make sure all the links are working. We do have to think about current links that Zach has been putting on Twitter and making sure that we're not just setting ourselves up to have a bunch of broken links. So I think there's a little bit of leg work. We at least have to think about my strategy standpoint, but we'll focus on that next week.

Piyush Choudhary: It shows we can always give a time for the final touches. but I'll try to make sure that the possible we have the pricing and points Etc. So it will look much better. We can implement this.

Denis Lelic: cool

Piyush Choudhary: So I think the direction is pretty solid so far. We are directions that can someone base. cost as well as smooth and we will continue doing the same and hopefully if not 10 days within next to the weeks, the new website will be like we show you on the official

Tyler Wright: amazing

Piyush Choudhary: Also I forgot you guys have time.

Denis Lelic: our piyush if anyone else has Time they can stay in this call. Otherwise if have Did you want to share something else?

Piyush Choudhary: If so, I just want to say that I got the access to the new docs. But we have to implement a dog space from scratch because the new design has been Contributes including the getting started page, but there is a content for doing the docs. So I just want you guys to take a look at the content that it's been done in the dark's new docs orders or code base. So we're doing cementing that content. So if it is incomplete, just We will not do that. It's complete. just inform us so we can Implement that content as it is and

Denis Lelic: Okay, cool.

Tyler Wright: Right. Yeah piyush. Can you throw that message and the Akash website working group channel, so I'll just make sure I'm clear because I might want to make sure that Scott is included on that conversation. So just throw anything related to the docs in working group of class website and then we can talk about async.

Piyush Choudhary: Sure, always.

Tyler Wright: All right, if there's nothing else and again, we can just drop off here. Some of us will be in contact with you shortly.

Meeting ended after 00:55:51 👋
