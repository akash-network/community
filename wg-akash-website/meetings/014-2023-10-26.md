## Meeting Notes
### Website Revamp Progress:
- Piyush Choudhary provided an update on the website development progress and structure, mentioning that the foundational structure is almost complete.
- Piyush mentioned that after discussions with Dennis, there will be some changes to the design and content.
- Piyush described the homepage and the upcoming changes to the "get started" page, which will be integrated into Akash documentation.
- Arthur asked about the high number of menu items on the website.
- Piyush Choudhary acknowledged the issue and mentioned that he would discuss it with Denis to reduce the number of menu items.
- Emmanuel suggested the possibility of using dropdown menus to organize related pages.
- Denis explained that in the past, dropdown menus were avoided due to restrictions from the Hugo template, and they preferred direct links to pages. However, they are open to reconsidering this approach if it becomes too crowded.
- Piyush Choudhary mentioned that within ten days, he could make the necessary changes for the new website to be launched.
- He suggested that even if real-time pricing data takes more time to implement, they could make the website live initially and add real-time features later.
#### Docs Integration
- Denis provided clarification regarding the history of the get started page and the Docs and its integration into the website..
- He mentioned that they initially created a get started page before bringing the docs into the website.
- Now, with Piyush and his team working on bringing the docs and website together, they are considering integrating the get started page into the Akash Docs.
- Denis emphasized the importance of integrating the "get started" page into Akash Docs to create a centralized hub of information for users.
- Denis explained that clicking on topics like "deploy an application" would lead to a page with Cloudmos and additional deployment resources linked to the same environment within the docs.
- Piyush mentioned that he had access to the docs but needed to integrate the to the website from scratch. He wanted everyone to review the content that had been created for the new docs.
- Denis Lelic expressed understanding and asked Piyush to share the content for review.
- Tyler Wright suggested that Piyush post a message in the Akash website working group channel to ensure clear communication, especially involving Scott in the conversation.
#### Website content and data sources discussion
- Piyush highlighted that all content comes from markdown files, making it accessible for non-technical individuals to update.
- Piyush mentioned the token page and price metrics, which will be fetched from Cloudmos APIs.
- Denis Lelic discussed the possibility of extracting network activity data from Cloudmos, particularly for the development section.
- Piyush explained the need for data from Cloudmos providers for three pages: pricing calculators, analytics, and network activity.
- Piyush mentioned that once the APIs are provided, they will implement real-time data on the Akash website, making the content dynamic.
#### AI assistant on the Akash Website 2.0
- Denis Lelic requested Piyush to access the Akash Web 2.0 Figma file.
- Denis pointed out the support page on the Figma file and discussed the idea of implementing an AI assistant on the support page.
- The AI assistant would allow users to ask questions and provide different resources in response.
- Piyush expressed that it's a good idea and suggested integrating an AI system on the page. It could handle various user queries and technical issues.
#### Tools and Apps to be featured on new website
- Denis discussed the need to replace a console on the website and suggested considering what kind of tool or app could be placed there.
- He mentioned that since they are sunsetting the console, they have the opportunity to feature a different tool.
- Zach Horn discussed the idea of [featuring SDXL](https://sdxl.akash.network/) on the Akash website and how it can serve as a touchpoint for users to experience Akash's computing capabilities.
- Tyler Wrexpressed support for the idea of showcasing SDXL and other AI-related apps on the website.
- Zach Horn expressed the desire to surface SDXL on the Akash website, as it allows users to experience Akash's computing capabilities by providing prompt-based image generation in seconds.
- Zach suggested integrating SDXL into the homepage section or creating a dedicated section for demos, allowing users to try Akash quickly and serving as a call to action for Akash AI/ML and GPU-related deployments.
- Tyler mentioned that he had experimented with these apps and emphasized the value of showing real deployments on Akash.
#### website revamp and pricing information
- Tyler noted that the new website will significantly improve the ability to answer common user questions regarding how to use Akash and the associated costs.
- Zach Horn commended the pricing page views, emphasizing their value and how much it has been needed.
- The group discussed the importance of addressing user questions about the cost of using Akash for various compute needs.
- Denis suggested the idea of having ready-made packages for users, such as general-purpose, GPU-optimized, and memory-optimized, to simplify the process.
- The need to display bids, potentially pulled from the console, was mentioned.
- Tyler noted the need for a team effort to ensure the accuracy and consistency of pricing calculations, as different tools currently yield varying results. 
- The collaboration with Cloudmos and core team members was mentioned
#### Discussion on pricing information and the complexities of calculating
- Scott Hewitson emphasized the complexity of pricing in an open marketplace like Akash and compared it to hosting on Airbnb, where earnings depend on various factors.
- Tyler Wright acknowledged the complexity and mentioned the need for some level of standardization. 
- He referred to a support tool built by Scott Caruthers for simulating deployments and suggested using real-time pricing data to calculate accurate prices.
- Zach Horn proposed showcasing deployment pricing on the website, allowing users to filter by specific configurations, such as Nvidia A100, and see the current pricing on the network. 
- He acknowledged the complexity of implementing this but highlighted the potential value it could provide.
### Deployment Page Task
- Piyush suggested assigning the task of moving a page back to its previous version to Arthur, as he had implemented the code.
- Emmanuel Arthur volunteered to work on this task.
- Denis Lelic and Piyush clarified that the task is to reverse the order of sections on the "deploy" page
- Piyush mentioned that the deploy page needs to be changed to refer to Cloudmos instead of console
- Denis Lelic suggested focusing on removing the console and just having the Cloudmos page initially
- Tyler Wright emphasized the importance of prioritizing the removal of the console and redirecting users to Cloudmos since the console is deprecated.
### Other matters Discussed
#### Homepage Hero Section Concerns
- Tyler Wright raised a question about the homepage hero section, expressing concerns about it being text-heavy compared to other websites.
- He shared a [link to an article](https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/tech/a-deep-dive-into-the-most-promising-projects/) featuring Akash Network, showcasing various website headers.
- Tyler suggested considering the addition of visual assets such as decentralized network or hardware imagery to enhance storytelling.
- Denis Lelic expressed support for the idea, mentioning that the current direction was inherited from the previous website.
- Denis suggested exploring what can be done to improve the hero section and researching current trends in other projects
