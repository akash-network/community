- AKT 2.0 features are missing from the left vertical navigation bar.

### Community Page Review
- The current content of the page is good, but the call to action needs improvement.
- The focus on "The Insider" content might be misplaced, as the SIGs and working groups are arguably more central to community initiatives.
- "Getting Started with Contributing" section should be moved above the fold for better visibility.
- "Community Groups" section should ideally be above the calendar for a clearer progression of information.
- Consider renaming "Community Groups" to "Special Interest Groups and Working Groups" for better clarity.
- The language in the "Get Started" section needs to be more direct and actionable.
- Instead of "scroll up to get started", it should be "join a SIG group and we'll get you started" or similar.
- User Groups: Remove placeholder information and add relevant user groups, such as mining.
- Working Groups: Replace placeholder information with active working groups and ensure links point to accurate content.
- Steering Committee: Update meeting schedule and time (last Thursday of the month).
- Standardize meeting schedule format: Use consistent wording for meeting frequency (e.g., "second Wednesday of every month").
- Investigate data source: Determine where the incorrect meeting information is coming from and update accordingly. 
- Denis Lelic will note in the minutes that data needs to be pulled from GitHub.
- Zach noted the need for significantly more content across the entire Community Page.

### Current Projects:
- The "Current Projects" section should link to the project boards, not the outdated information currently displayed.
- Tyler Wright suggested creating two separate links, one for the product and engineering board and another for the community and marketing board.
- Embedding the boards directly on the page was also discussed as an option.
- The team agreed to leave the section titles as-is for now, but revisit the possibility of combining them later.

#### Akash.Edu
- Denis clarified that the current "Akash.Edu" entries are not live programs.
- Tyler suggested linking all of them to the OmniFlix page as a starting point for users to explore further education options.
- Zach and Denis agreed with linking to OmniFlix for now, but acknowledging the current lack of specific "Akash.Edu" content.
- Tyler voiced disagreement with Adam's suggestion to remove the "Akash.Edu" section entirely, arguing it should remain as a general starting point for education resources.


### Ecosystem Pgae:
- Links under the header need to be updated, including replacing "console" with "cloudmos."
- Update links and rename "SDXL" to something more fitting.
- Tyler suggested "Tools" before "Showcase."
- Denis suggested prioritizing important items over alphabetical order.
#### Navigation and structure of the Ecosystem page
- Confusion around navigation: Users are having difficulty finding the "Providers" page within the "Ecosystem" section.
- Current navigation: Users land on the "Tools" page when navigating to "Ecosystem," then need to tab over to "Providers."
- Prioritize "Providers" in the navigation: This could involve moving it higher in the navigation bar or making it the default landing page for the "Ecosystem" section.
- Improve internal linking: Make it easier for users to navigate to the "Providers" page from other parts of the website, including the "Showcase" page.
- Create a dedicated "Providers" page: Separate the "Become a Provider" information from the general "Providers" page. This could involve creating a new page at /network/providers or /get-started/become-a-provider.
- The grouo agreed that the "Providers" page is an important resource for users and needs to be easily accessible.
#### "Become a Provider" Path:
- Tyler finds the current "Get Started" page unclear for users who want to become providers.
- He suggests adding separate buttons for deployment and becoming a provider.
- Zach agrees and emphasizes the need for persona-based navigation design.
- Zach proposes revisiting persona-based navigation design to optimize user experience for different user types (providers, deployers, etc.).
#### Readability of Provider Names:
- Current naming convention using prefixes is confusing and requires improvement.
- Denis proposed grabbing two letters from the provider link as a temporary solution.
- Zach acknowledges the need for more user-friendly names and suggests revisiting this issue later.
Community Navigation Dropdown:
- Tyler suggests adding a dropdown menu with options like "Akash Insiders" and "Providers" for easier navigation.
- Denis acknowledges the benefits of dropdowns but explains Greg's preference for avoiding them.
- They agree to consider dropdowns for future website iterations.
### Blog:
- Dates: Fix date format to remove periods and use single dots as separators.
- Search: Search functionality works well with autocomplete suggestions.
- Titles: Titles displayed as cards look good.
- Hover state: Improve hover state for card images to keep them connected to the border and shadow.
- Content: Current blog content is not up-to-date and needs to be replaced with latest versions from GitHub.
- Code blocks: Review code block rendering in new blog posts. Current example shows formatting issues.
### Documentation Page Review
- Body copy: Rewrite needed for "explore the world of Akash..." section. Ensure single periods instead of double.
- Essentials section: Idea approved, but content needs refinement. "Common questions" should be rephrased as "FAQ" and may not belong under "Essentials."
- SDL: Rename "tenants customers" to "Find deployment services" for clarity.
- Overall structure: Current organization (Essentials, Deployments, Providers) considered confusing. "Deploy application" under "Providers" doesn't make sense.
- Revisit documentation navigation structure and organization for better user flow.
- The group agreed to prioritize certain elements for V1 launch and table others for future iterations.
- More discussion on specific content suggestions and icon usage is needed.
- The group acknowledged the need for a quick fix for the "Spotlight your work" section while planning for potential broader adjustments to the structure and content in the future.
#### Documentation Navigation:
- Fix typo in "Engineering Notes" header.
- Define the purpose and target audience for "Engineering Notes" and adjust content accordingly.
- Review and improve the documentation navigation flow, reducing depth and confusion.
- Streamline the "Getting Started" section to provide key information concisely.
- Consistency issue identified: "Engineering Notes" should be "Engineering Documentation" for clarity.
- Content duplication: Both "Akash Documentation" and "Engineering Notes" sections have the same content pulled from existing documentation.
- Decision made to use "Engineering Documentation" and focus on clarity for its purpose.
- Continued discussion about the mismatch between the new documentation structure and the existing content that doesn't fully fit within it.
- "Getting Started" section considered too detailed and layered, causing unnecessary navigation depth.
- Proposal to restructure "Getting Started" for better information distribution and avoid overwhelming users.
- Lack of clear way to return to the main website from the Akash Docs section is a major issue.
- Implementing an "Akash.network" button in the Docs navigation and stats page is a critical fix for V1.
### Stats page update from Max
- Max finalizing website improvements, including mobile menu and navbar fixes.
- Team prefers Max's branded network stats design.
- Denis provided navigation feedback for Max to incorporate.
- Group decided to move forward with Max's current website version and avoid placeholder link for network stats.
### Small Grants Program for Experiments:
- Denis introduced the idea of a casual program for users to present ideas and potentially receive up to a few hundred AKT for smaller experiments, without the formality of a governance proposal.
- Tyler agreed and suggested building out the program later, but for now, using a Typeform to assess requests is acceptable.
- Update the "Funding" section with a button linking to the Typeform for the small grants program.
## Action Items:
- Max to deploy stats website updates today.
- Tyler to notify group when Max deploys and suggest reviewing over weekend.
- Denis to update testimonial links in Figma, ensuring they point to correct sources.
- Tyler to update the copy on pages not touched by Zach, including those written by Greg
- Group to discuss consistency in naming the roadmap sections ("Community & Marketing Initiatives" vs. "Product & Engineering Roadmap") during the next meeting.
- There was agreement on the need for future meetings to address navigation and provider information in more detail.
- Tyler to update the "Funding" section with a button linking to the Typeform for the small grants program.
- A list of identified issues and potential improvements will be sent to Piyush for further development.
- Group to luaunh website on Monday, 8th January

Tyler Wright: All right, welcome everybody to this working session for the sh website working group. This is a third working group Akash website, session of this week. I'm starting off 2024 strong as we push and work is diligently as quickly as possible to launch the revamped website over the last couple of weeks and his team have been on updating content focusing on dark mode optimizing the screen for all sizes mobile tablet Etc. And so again, those elements have been fine-tuned prior to that person's team. We're working on to documentation 2.0. Integration and transfer from Hugo and prior to that from getbook over to the new astro system.

Tyler Wright: This meeting is focused on punch-ups and again finalizing copy of a head of a potential and desired launch of Sunday night Monday morning, January 8th 2024. Again, the goal is to launch the website when it's a little bit quieter and we talked about this in great detail yesterday where members of overclock team as well as members of human HQ will work together to do the transfer of the website. When it's quieter on against early Monday morning.

Tyler Wright: again, this meeting was supposed to be around finalizing punch-up copy going through the website page by Page to make sure that there's no inaccuracies and working closely with petitions team. They do have a conflict and cannot make this meeting. So the goal of this meeting really is to go through the website, talk about any issues that still might be happening with the revamped website, whether it be copy or design. We'll make sure this video is made available and GitHub but we'll share this video with puge directly after this meeting along with a detailed list of items that still need to be checked off the list. And again, we'll put down a Checklist format for PS so that through the weekend we can monitor and make sure that all those items that need to be are changed.

Tyler Wright: I'm going to walk us through each page of the website as suggested by Zach and we will start to take notes of anything that are inaccurate or need to be updated. And then again, we will go from there. So I'm going to be displaying my screen and Zach Dennis or anybody else that happens to join this call. Feel free to drop in the chat.

Tyler Wright: Any suggestions or just raise your hands and we can start going Page by Page related to things that need to be updated. I'm going to drop again the staging website in the chat for folks, but I will just put myself on mute and feel free to just guide me through the page and we can talk about any items when we get to the docs page. I have some items that I've been told thinking about just want to share so anybody have any items in the homepage that need to be optim.

Zach Horn: I appreciate your formality that it does. It makes me laugh a little bit that it's just the three of us.

Zach Horn: For the homepage. Yeah, the things that jump out right off the bat are the stats page that's under construction. Is that going to get Linked In the nav?

Denis Lelic: Yeah, it's like in the net work network activity So this drop down so pretty much for everything Network related.

Zach Horn: Okay.

Zach Horn: We're right, okay.

Denis Lelic: so there's about Akash page network activity meeting stats and the akt token, And this is something Pierce started working on. but in the meantime Greg O'Neil and Max had a meeting where they decide and when I separate this in a completely different page so max started working on it and then I asked basically to stop working on this thing because we don't want to double the work for the same thing, but at the moment pretty much serves

00:05:00

Denis Lelic: as a placeholder, although all the stats and all the content is real and it's being pulled from cloudmouse.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's great.

Denis Lelic: Yeah. Yeah.

Zach Horn: Is it real time or near real time?

Zach Horn: Wow, okay, that's fantastic. So the one question here is so drop down the network in the Network activity. Yeah, that makes sense to me. But if it's gonna be branded as stats, we should incorporate that because I couldn't even find it so I can only assume that people are gonna get lost in that same way. So maybe you call it stats. I've got to think about that a little bit as to what the copy would be. But we just need to work in stats…

Denis Lelic: I asked on you and…

Zach Horn: if that's…

Tyler Wright: Hey.

Zach Horn: how it's gonna be branded.

Denis Lelic: Max a couple of times how will users reach the stats and Is it a reachable through the website and so on so I didn't get clear Direction. So I just said okay, we have something that we've been working on in the working group. And do you agree with this approach? And I know you said yes and Max pretty much said I asking you so

Zach Horn: Yeah, I could.

Tyler Wright: just a spelling call out that I just saw if you look at this menu because I was going to ask maybe it stays network activity. But maybe Zach we can update this copy. So it makes very clear that statistics even because it says latest statistical I don't know but then it got me looking for the store room. I think it's supposed to be story but it's like why it's a you instead of a y. Can you all see that as well?

Zach Horn: Yeah. I can there's a million of those all over the place.

Denis Lelic: yeah.

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Zach Horn: So that's the primary thing that we need to go through. But yes, you're correct that needs to get updated.

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Zach Horn: So click through to that page again really quickly the stats page. I may have seen a different version of this because I feel like I saw a version that was branded as stats like it had its own custom logo.

Tyler Wright: that's Bird that is a page.

Zach Horn: Was that not the page that's going to go live?

Tyler Wright: That's a page at Max is working on and so that page I think Max says he's gonna have us it in testing today at Stats that network…

Zach Horn: Okay.

Tyler Wright: but until we want to publicize that basically we have this page. It's a placeholder that pulls from the same API, but we will not use this page.

Zach Horn: I see.

Tyler Wright: Basically what will happen and Denis correct me if I'm wrong is when Max's page is ready, basically when you click on network activity it'll take you outside the website. I'll take you to Stats that network is some domain that will have the Branded page that you have seen Zach.

Denis Lelic: Yep.

Zach Horn: Got it, I would recommend strongly that. We just call it Akash stats in the nav. I think that's going to be a lot cleaner. Not a hill. I'm gonna die on but that would be my strong recommendation. Also Denis. are you jotting these things in a doc as we're going through? Thanks.

Denis Lelic: Yep, I am.

Tyler Wright: I'm sorry. I don't…

Zach Horn: another thing to put down in yeah time.

Tyler Wright: I'm real quick. I was just looking at the understanding the role of the akt toke in the Akashi ecosystem. So just another one to note that yeah.

Zach Horn: Yeah yet another. And there will be many more on the way.

Zach Horn: Also the dollar sign and that section heading needs to be removed.

Tyler Wright: cool

Zach Horn: Otherwise that looks clean-ish.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: The other major item for the homepage has there been feedback outside of this group about those ctas right at the top? So the buttons and then the buttons and the hero.

Denis Lelic: 

Zach Horn: Because I know we've gone back and forth a million times on what those are going to be. I think they look. Okay personally. It's a little disjointed to have One reach out one that says get started so close to each other but I don't think that's a blocker at least for this initial launch.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I saw the discussion with Greg about reach out. So I'm not really sure. What's the decision to go with now? I thought he had an issue with the Reach Out.

00:10:00

Zach Horn: 

Zach Horn: Yeah, it's not quite clear enough who that is, and I know we have to get dancing around the fact that we don't want to link to a team page or this idea of having a team, but we do need to think about that a little bit. I'm more on the page of get started. I think that's much cleaner deploy now is good either way. So as long as that's the highlighted CTA, I think we're fine.

Denis Lelic: Okay, cool.

Tyler Wright: Am I a mute? No. Yes. No, I'm not. I think they are two different calls to action though. I just want to clarify that one I believe is the reach out which takes you to type form if you wanted participate in understand about gpus and do and the other textures that get started page.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, that's correct.

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Zach Horn: So technically yes,…

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Zach Horn: but for someone that doesn't know that information before they land on this page, it's not communicated clearly, So you only understand that where those pages are leading you if you just land on this page and you're seeing it for the first time, they're not differentiated enough to understand that.

Tyler Wright: Fair

Zach Horn: But we can table that and come back to it. I don't think it's a blocker for now.

Tyler Wright: okay.

Denis Lelic: I mean we can change that. Easily, we just have to figure out

Denis Lelic: I don't know if it's the wording or yeah, maybe we just get this one and

Denis Lelic: and move down

Zach Horn: Yeah, let's take a look for now.

Denis Lelic: I think that the section is updated and I'll Zach you've left your comments into figma.

Zach Horn: Yeah, I think it looks good. It can always be tweaked and we probably should Circle back at some point at a section that highlights gpus. A Max I don't.

Zach Horn: But I don't think that's a blocker for right now. I would say we keep it as it is push this live and then we can Circle back and add to it. because as I understand profuse these sections are Very easy to update it's just literally going in and making the content changes. On GitHub,…

Denis Lelic: Yep.

Zach Horn: right? It's not more complicated than that. cool

Tyler Wright: Hey Max, just for your reference. We're just going through Page by page of the website and talking about any additional punch-up copy that needs to be updated. Denis is taking a list that we're going to share with peers. Pierce wasn't able to make it to this meeting today. He had a conflict that came up last minute. I know that you're busy with the things so you can feel free to stay in but I know that you are also working on the stats data cost on network page. We just kind of talked about that because again Zach and the rest of us really like the Branded version that you have and so just wanted to again you can. As long as you want, but just want to stop real fast to see if you want to give an update on the stats that network page and ask any other questions if you wanted to hop on and hop.

Max: Yeah, like I said yesterday just finishing up more details with the Denis. It's mostly yeah, I fixed the mobile menu well added and improve the mobile menu. the header with the links just a lot of fixes and little details, I guess and yeah, so I'll deploy it today no matter what so After that, if there's more fixes to do we'll just do it. In other iterations just update the website. So yeah, sure. Should be good.

Denis Lelic: thank you.

Tyler Wright: excellent Yeah. Thank you Max. So I guess I'm just an action I'm there when Max deploys it. I'll just drop a message in the chat for folks and we could just look at that page over the weekend, but

Tyler Wright: I would strongly urge and I think Zach mentioned it before Max joined that whatever state is in because I think it was in a great state at that yesterday. I think that details that Denis mentioned about the navbar a great details to add I think it sounds like those didn't added. I would vote that. We just move forward with the version that Max has and just Link in the activity section directly to Stats at network and not use this placeholder. That they might have any objections there. Just as we an action item for again for peers to link that to staff at a constant Network.

00:15:00

Zach Horn: No, I think that's perfect. I think you should drop down the network. It should say Akash stats that have an arrow and just link out directly from there.

Tyler Wright: I would agree with that. cool All I got Max feel free to stay on but I know that you're working on a million things. So if you need to drop no worries.

Tyler Wright: I know that we were talking we're at this section. Does anyone have any thoughts questions concerns about this section copy imagery Etc?

Zach Horn: Yeah, that body copy still needs to be updated.

Zach Horn: Not quite sure why that's taking so long, but that needs to be done. As soon as possible, I mean, this is the fourth time I'm asking.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I've asked as well in tagged push, so maybe I don't know.

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Denis Lelic: I think he updated the website so it should be populated with the new content

Zach Horn: Okay, but it's populated, but it's not showing here.

Denis Lelic: I don't know not sure one more thing about this section about the breakpoints powerful flexible and…

Zach Horn: Okay.

Denis Lelic: And maybe new second line starting with design for what's next.

Tyler Wright: to just like formatting you're saying

Denis Lelic: yeah, formatting so after and

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Basically, the first word in the second line would be designed for what's next.

Zach Horn: I'm here nor there on that. if that's the design decision. I think that's fine. I wouldn't hold this up too much on it though would be my personal opinion. Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Okay, then we can skip it.

Zach Horn: Other than that, I think it looks good. I really like the images you did Dennis.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, thanks.

Zach Horn: This section also needs to be updated similar to the one we just talked about the header in the section also needs to be in sentence case not title case.

Denis Lelic: Yes finding only one. so Cosmos SDK

Denis Lelic: It's only where the first capital letters.

Zach Horn: that's a good question. I don't know layer one is proper. I have to go look that up.

Denis Lelic: and so protocol is the only one lowercase Okay,…

Tyler Wright: Basically lowercase. Yeah, I may be layer one.

Denis Lelic: we can come back on this one.

Zach Horn: Slightly minor but it is important. Okay? to manage free public service.

Zach Horn: This looks solid where does the Ecosystem links out to the ecosystem page obviously. Yeah, okay.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: over there on the left Dev tools with an s

Denis Lelic: Okay. Can we just go back maybe on the homepage so we can finalize the homepage and we can discuss this on the ecosystem page? so I just keep a list of

Tyler Wright: Perfect.

Zach Horn: Sure.

Denis Lelic: All items related to the homepage. Yeah one thing.

Zach Horn: Yes, sounds good

Denis Lelic: I think all of these are working. Except Pierce linked the deployed on So these three examples were showcasing here. There are linked to their website and I was thinking if we just

Denis Lelic: Link it to the ecosystem to their page. I mean, it's not a page. It's more like a section. So osmosis is I don't know the category is called exchanges or something. So deploy it on Akash. So maybe it's defy.

00:20:00

Zach Horn: So if you jump back to the home page quickly that section we were just on.

Denis Lelic: should link

Zach Horn: We really need to double check the fact on this osmosis section because the way that it's positioned right now makes it seem like the entirety of Osmosis is deployed. On Akash, which is to my knowledge is not accurate.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: I know that there was some talk about API servers at one point, but we do. It can't remain position the way it is if the entirety of their operation is employed that's misleading.

Denis Lelic: We can add another example here, but it could be here or…

Zach Horn: mmm

Denis Lelic: something. We Chia did it.

Zach Horn: I would stay away from Shia personally.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: No, I was just trying to figure out. Project or a case that has been using the couch.

Tyler Wright: I could do passage or something if we want.

Zach Horn: 

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Making an action at this as an action item. I'll find one project to replace osmosis decks with.

Denis Lelic: one project to replace

Zach Horn: I would replace a pre-search as well.

Tyler Wright: the two projects that look for this this is Yeah.

Zach Horn: But Thumper is good. that's good.

Zach Horn: Call up for this section.

Tyler Wright: Quick. This might just be me.

Tyler Wright: But do we feel like this copy for AI ML and deployed on Akash to be bigger and Bolder and no matter speed me.

Denis Lelic: it's a label. So all of the labels are pretty much the same across the website. and it's just indicating a group for each of these and you can find these groups on the ecosystem Pages as well.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, that makes sense.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, what do you think about I don't like. This experience where these three tiles are going and taking the users away from the website. So it's First of all, it's so not opening a new tab. So you're leaving the website? so

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I would say at the very least it should open up to a new tab at the very least.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I understand your reservation about some of these things. I would prefer that it would go to a product detail page, but I don't think we have that for the ecosystem and I don't know if this section going to just a menu. Makes that much different I would be all right with and not again as we always say it's not a hill. I'll die on but I would be alright with it linking in a new tab to their website. But then again staying on the current cost website as well.

Denis Lelic: Okay link.

Zach Horn: Yeah, That's a great call out. I would say I'd agree with Ty at the minimum just like it out into a new tab. I think that's an easy way to get around it. product detail Pages would be ideal, but I don't Let's not hold this up for right now.

Tyler Wright: right agree

Zach Horn: I think let's just get this line and we can Circle back on that.

Denis Lelic: okay links to a new tab. I got it.

Zach Horn: A cloud most section there needs to update that can be on me. I will do that. traitor

Zach Horn: that's good.

Zach Horn: That needs a new title section because That's not going to be legible to anyone who doesn't know what that is a collection of xcls.

Denis Lelic: Awesome Akash templates. It's in figma.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's good. It's still a little obscure. But that's fine for now. That's not get held up.

Denis Lelic: of tools

Zach Horn: that free public service needs to change. I will come up with something for that.

Tyler Wright: What do you think about adding telegram as a button here?

Zach Horn: I think that's good. Yeah.

Zach Horn: I'd even be tempted to put Twitter directly in that section, especially if you're gonna call out.

00:25:00

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: sweets right below that I'm sorry X

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I know that Denis and I talked about. These testimonials and I think we have a list of four. That work and make sense. And so this will get updated. I believe directly following this meeting.

Zach Horn: yeah, I think those are solid. Definitely the one from Jeremy there is very good. Scroll over to the left, please.

Denis Lelic: I've added four new ones during figma. And got one from Luna got one from ZJ. So it's more like Dev related But I just told Tyler from my perspective. It's cool to have a mix. For example to have Anatoly there from Solana and even some community members like DJ.

Zach Horn: Yeah, totally agree with that.

Denis Lelic: and all of them are linking to the direct posts On Twitter.

Tyler Wright: Whatever the medium is. Yeah.

Denis Lelic: It's basically just Twitter but the one from anatol is linking at the moment. I dropped a comment in figma. For peers to update it.

Zach Horn: Here's the only thing as some of these handles don't correlate to names, especially with Sammy there. Do we want to Include their names I'm thinking we should but I also don't want to hold this up at that breaks the design. What do you think?

Denis Lelic: It's not breaking the design. It's basically just rewriting the so instead of a username.

Zach Horn: mmm

Zach Horn: I mean Yeah, I understand. I mean including both some names and full names and handles. I guess you could do that the same one.

Denis Lelic: Or we can add an it's good to have a job title as well.

Tyler Wright: Yeah. You can put it in front of the job title.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: If you want to my only hesitation there is right now, I don't know if we need attribution or accreditation whatever you want to call because they're just pulling it from X, but then we use their real name. Do we have to ask them if we can use it? I don't know.

Zach Horn: That is a good question. It's public information. So I would say this Falls pretty firmly under the category of beg forgiveness, but that is an excellent question. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Yeah. I'm fine with that.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, basically we're Also linking the source, so it's more like quoting.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I think it's fine.

Zach Horn: I would say let's roll with it. If we get any pushback whatsoever. We can change.

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Denis Lelic: So any action items there?

Tyler Wright: I think the only action item is you had that he needs to link all these properly if they're not linked already. I think you put that in figma, but I would love for pigmented to be the second source of truth. But this list that we're creating today to be like, all right, he needs to check everything off of this list and that's how we know stuff is gonna be done, Because to your point we've talked to a couple of times.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I know he's doing so much but some of these changes to the home page. I feel like should have been made by now. So maybe it's just slipping through the cracks.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: Yeah, second that I would like to get to a comprehensive list and then just make sure that everything is checked off. So there's questions. I think this section is good a couple of very minor things. There should be no period after the author name.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, right.

Zach Horn: in the …

Tyler Wright: but that Zach you are so strong.

Zach Horn: go ahead.

Tyler Wright: You're a full sentence, you are a noun and…

Zach Horn: Okay, that's exactly right.

Tyler Wright: a verb you Good. Yeah.

Denis Lelic: It's like a mic drop.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's a absolutely right forgot. I said leave it.

Zach Horn: In the bottom section There's a period in between five minute read in the date that period should go after men and then there should be a different punctuation mark in between maybe a dash.

00:30:00

Denis Lelic: Yeah, there's another one in figma. It's actually like a DOT which is Slightly higher and it serves like a separator between these two.

Zach Horn: yeah. Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, but it shouldn't be a period period so

Zach Horn: I know the market talking about that would be great if they could do that. Otherwise a dash would be fine.

Denis Lelic: so five men dot read

Zach Horn: yeah, five men dot read and then some kind of Separation Mark and then Technically that does need a period but I've seen some modern designs where they leave it out. So let's just leave it out. Let's not I can log down on that.

Zach Horn: And then below that doesn't excuse me.

Zach Horn: This section is in general just a little sparse. I Yeah,…

Tyler Wright: that we Sorry.

Zach Horn: tiger go ahead.

Zach Horn: No, no, go ahead.

Tyler Wright: I was gonna add candy.

Tyler Wright: Can we add an image behind this text that has GPU types,…

Zach Horn: mmm

Tyler Wright: it has CPUs and…

Zach Horn: 

Tyler Wright: GPU that has a picture of an video and stuff like that.

Zach Horn: That's a great idea is. Do you remember that image? We did a while back it was like a very minimal deconstructing grid of GPU types. Each one was in their own little box. You remember that image? Could we Yeah,…

Denis Lelic: yeah, I do but Don't know finish your sentence.

Zach Horn: go ahead.

Zach Horn: Could we do a background section for this that has that with all the different GPU types and then do it cut out in the center where that copy essentially gets cut out of those squares, you know what I mean?

Denis Lelic: Yeah, but personally I would leave this. Maybe we can update this thing when it's life.

Zach Horn: You're saying just put it off for now and then Circle back to it. Okay. Yeah,…

Denis Lelic: Yeah. Yeah, maybe We just focus on the most crucial things to get this thing done and…

Zach Horn: that's fine.

Denis Lelic: then we can have around two where we can.

Denis Lelic: Basically improve some of the graphics or whatever, but personally I would just prefer to knock off all the spellings and things that are popping out

Zach Horn: That's good today.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I would agree with that. I'm fine with doing that. The only thing I want to call out I talk to Zach about this offline yesterday, but I know there's been specific feedback from folks that when they go to the website. It's not explicitly clear that there are gpus available on the network.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: It would be great to highlight that on the homepage some way somehow and maybe again maybe we don't do it right now.

Zach Horn: alright

Tyler Wright: But this one put that out there.

Zach Horn: let's do this scroll back up to the second section below the hero

Denis Lelic: Yeah here.

Zach Horn: I will come up with one. that highlights gpus That's a good call out. initially I had that on a list of things. We would Circle back on but that's a good call. I will come up with a GPU section.

Zach Horn: That's about it for me on the homepage. I think we're looking solid. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: What can I come? Perfect a couple call outs and I just want to reiterate so if you go the network section right here on the footer it says To Zach's point if we're going to put stats in the footer. I think we should just keep it consistent in the header as well. but I believe and…

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: let me know if you all have any feedback about this instead of stats. I would put stats Akash ecosystem about Akash and then akt token just because it doesn't say Akash networking like this header and maybe we just continue to build brand awareness by just having Akash as a word in all does that make it two? I feel like there's enough space that we can update that but what do you all think about that versus just stats ecosystem about Akash or token?

Zach Horn: No, that's a great call out. There are SEO considerations there as well. So yes, It should say Akash for all of those.

Tyler Wright: Okay, And this is not something we have to do with round one. But I also do want to call out. I'm inclined to put the YouTube as we build it out in 2024 to have included an AV bar because I think it's going to be a lot of great videos that people can have there and access there and then maybe we should also. It's already in the footer, but maybe we need to add telegram to the footer.

00:35:00

Tyler Wright: Just because again,…

Zach Horn: Telegram it should be in the footer.

Tyler Wright: there's a community there.

Zach Horn: Yeah. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: One other thing and I don't know if there's a small data. I know that there's blog In the navbar rather, but when you go to discover, what Discover what's happening to be on Akasha Akash, it doesn't matter to me. But I was wondering you have these three entries. Is there a way or do we think it's important enough to have read the blog and have the call to action in this section so that people can get to the blog directly from this section or…

Zach Horn: Here should be a link to view all coasts from that section.

Tyler Wright: do you think it's fine just to happen in a nap or

Tyler Wright: okay.

Zach Horn: And to the grammar point it's on because it's a platform if it was a singular entity it would…

Tyler Wright: Perfect.

Zach Horn: but I hear you on that.

Tyler Wright: No, no, that's why I asked the content King. I'm trying to learn something on a Friday and I just did

Zach Horn: Learn something new every day.

Tyler Wright: Not every day but today.

Denis Lelic: You're gonna…

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's right.

Denis Lelic: then you gotta forget something every day.

Zach Horn: I think we're looking good on the homepage. What do you guys think?

Tyler Wright: So I agree. Do we want to go to about Akash or…

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: we want to go to development?

Zach Horn: Let's just go in order to tell me about.

Zach Horn: I think this is fine. This is pulling a meals slides.

Tyler Wright: Me too.

Zach Horn: I say. Okay.

Tyler Wright: Mm-hmm

Denis Lelic: Yeah. I think you skipped providers.

Tyler Wright: I asked a bunch of sections. Sorry.

Denis Lelic: so providers this is data pooling from Cosmos

Zach Horn: exactly This is real time.

Denis Lelic: real time. Yeah.

Zach Horn: fantastic

Tyler Wright: Yeah, it's really cool.

Zach Horn: Go back to the world map there.

Denis Lelic: and there

Zach Horn: That's such a compelling image. I'm gonna wait till we launch this but we need to do a lot more of that. It's just a great visual, but either way, so that's populating in real time based on provided data from the chain.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I mean,…

Zach Horn: Wow.

Denis Lelic: we're relying on cloud nose here.

Tyler Wright: that

Zach Horn: Sure.

Denis Lelic: So when I say yes, I'm assuming. Cloud nose is working properly.

Tyler Wright: yeah.

Zach Horn: either way that's awesome.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, that's something from my perspective that was missing in all of the website's Akash had.

Tyler Wright: for sure.

Zach Horn: He

Denis Lelic: I don't know who's sharing the screen. Can you just move down a little bit?

Denis Lelic: Then we have this image and I'm not sure from who it is, but it's kind of like explaining the flow of becoming a provider. It's either a needle or a boss. Not sure really.

Denis Lelic: But I guess it doesn't matter.

Zach Horn: I think It's a great technical overview. Let me put it this way. The upside is a great technical overview. The downside is that it's a great technical overview.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, but let's hope.

Zach Horn: I think it's fine for now. But we need to Circle back at some point to simplify that a little bit. it's very academic. Not necessarily a bad thing, but let's table that for now. I think It's fine for this launch.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, It's better than what we have previously which was nothing.

Zach Horn: No Doubt

Denis Lelic: One thing sorry to cut you off. I think it's called providers and incentives should we just call it providers?

Zach Horn: Yeah, maybe.

Tyler Wright: Yes.

00:40:00

Zach Horn: Yes, that's a good call. Nobody.

Denis Lelic: Because we call it tenants, the next chapter.

Tyler Wright: Mm-hmm

Zach Horn: Yeah, I like that.

Tyler Wright: I wonder and Zach. I apologize. If you've already touched this copy…

Zach Horn: but you

Tyler Wright: if you touched it already then obviously what you say goes, but for this offer your compute Resources with creator app.

Tyler Wright: I wonder if it should be like

Tyler Wright: Basically around how the ease of building a provider using pretor? as opposed to it to me it reads now this is how you offer your computer Resources by going to prey tour as opposed to pray. There's only one way to do it but prayers the easiest and fastest way to build a provider.

Zach Horn: okay.

Tyler Wright: That's the only Maybe I'm just saying two semantics and obviously it's not a blocker, but I just want to hear…

Denis Lelic: You have basically in the sub headline…

Tyler Wright: what if anybody has.

Denis Lelic: which he describe?

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Zach Horn: I haven't touched this copy. So feel free. It's open season.

Tyler Wright: Okay, cool. maybe I would just switch those two because again, I don't want people to get confused I have to use prey door to set up a provider. that's just the fastest And does this link to documentation? If it doesn't it should.

Denis Lelic: Which one?

Zach Horn: right

Tyler Wright: This entire section I guess providers.

Denis Lelic: You can launch the Prater app. and you can

Tyler Wright: Use the Pareto calculator, but nowhere on this page.

Denis Lelic: yeah.

Tyler Wright: Can you go to the provider docs to see earn with Akash it I think it should go to provide to the provider docs because they can learn about bit engine scripts so you can learn about all that kind of stuff right now just like it takes you to Predator calculator, which is a fine tool, but I was going to talk to you both offline or internally at marketing next week about basically getting more hands on in traitor, because this is a tool. I'm sure works. But has not been fully fully vented if

Denis Lelic: We could maybe link to get started page and…

Tyler Wright: what I mean.

Denis Lelic: become a provider which basically explains everything provider related around Prater. So you have a link to calculate a calculator stats, you can launch the Prater app there and there's different tutorials and links to the docs.

Tyler Wright: Perfect.

Denis Lelic: But I think there's additional CTA at the bottom.

Denis Lelic: During the supercloud provider Network and become a provider and this will take you to get started with Twitter app.

Zach Horn: on a previous page where you just were

Zach Horn: Let's have that just Take provider Network out of that section copy.

Denis Lelic: join the supercloud

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I also think that we need to remove provider incentives from this line right here. also says provider in Inventions,…

Denis Lelic: invention

Tyler Wright: but there's no formal provider incentives program right now and last thing we do want with people go into this page. what's the presentation? How can I it's just like we just want people to earn on Akash

Zach Horn: And I'm gonna put this on the record because we're being transcribed here.

Zach Horn: When we're getting deliverables for websites, we should not be catching this level of spelling errors these are things that need to be resolved well in advance. I know we're all in the same page with that, but we should not be catching simple spelling errors like this in a final product.

Tyler Wright: agreed

Zach Horn: But also yes, that should just be removed entirely.

Tyler Wright: All right, any other things on the provider section here before? We move on to tenants.

Zach Horn: Now looks good tonight.

00:45:00

Denis Lelic: can you just go back to the calculator

Denis Lelic: the view trailer called calculator. There's a GitHub. I can be an arrow.

Denis Lelic: So we remove provider inventives, earn with a class

Zach Horn: Yeah, just remove an entirely and the semicolon.

Denis Lelic: earn with Akash

Denis Lelic: Got it.

Zach Horn: What? provided to you

Zach Horn: Otherwise, I think we're good here. So what's we're on tennis Wright's surprising. no, this is Akash hours tenants

Zach Horn: that sounds good. let's start with

Zach Horn: we do need to introduce the concept of sdl in a way. That's more understandable, but that's always been a bit of an issue because we have this custom language that we need to explain to people need an intro people to what it is and then how it works but I don't think that's anything we need to hash out here sort of template on your Startup template or your own customer application? That sounds good.

Denis Lelic: This is basically a graphic from one of the presentation's. but later on we can have …

Zach Horn: Yeah. Looks good.

Denis Lelic: a proper web module where this is written with a proper text. This is not a graphic and we can add a CTA there or a question mark So when you hover it's going to explain what the sdl is and stuff like that. maybe for around

Zach Horn: sounds good.

Denis Lelic: there's a headline missing there.

Zach Horn: Okay, so if we keep scrolling.

Zach Horn: Which yeah the next one. Yes.

Denis Lelic: outlined missing

Zach Horn: Yeah, we just need a headline. Otherwise, that looks good.

Denis Lelic: let me just check what?

Zach Horn: Or whatever. Yeah that full with section at the bottom looks good.

Tyler Wright: For this section right here. Isn't console dead. Or is this gonna push us up to Cloud those…

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: which is going to be rebranded. Okay.

Denis Lelic: Cloud nose here just one second. This is about right tenants. I just want to have a so we seamless deployment with Cloud most templates. It says.

Zach Horn: You saying that?

Tyler Wright: Okay, think the thing was updated.

Zach Horn: 

Denis Lelic: and instead Akash console it says cloudmouse, okay.

Tyler Wright: What about the image?

Zach Horn: I

Denis Lelic: The image is console, but I just changed it to what's the other one Cloud one?

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Zach Horn: I don't want to forget let's sync on This topic directly after this meeting. I need to Hash something out with you quick.

Tyler Wright: cool

Zach Horn: But let's just keep moving. Okay, so this looks good.

Tyler Wright: Sounds good.

Zach Horn: Footers the same on all pages

Tyler Wright: So now We've done network activity.

Zach Horn: All right. What do we got next?

Tyler Wright: We'll go to akt token.

Zach Horn: We talked about the dollar sign right so that gets removed.

Denis Lelic: Is it here? I don't see it.

Zach Horn: as in the map

Denis Lelic: Okay. Yeah, sorry.

Zach Horn: That looks solid.

Tyler Wright: And are we talked about the AKG toke right that needs to be updated as well.

Zach Horn: right

Zach Horn: So we scroll down.

Tyler Wright: And let me okay real quick. You see how I'm on this page. I'm at the top. I click on how it works. And it just basically goes up two inches should it go up to the top right here?

00:50:00

Denis Lelic: can you do it again?

Tyler Wright: Yeah You see around at the top right now. How it works it just lifted up.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Good catch.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's a good call out copy. That looks fine if we keep going. We need to standardize the sentence case or title case.

Zach Horn: my votes would be Title case for this page. We're a little bit disjointed across the board on that, but Let's not get bogged down on that.

Denis Lelic: ecosystem tools

Zach Horn: I know so all the section titles either need to be incentive case or…

Denis Lelic: across yeah

Zach Horn: title case. The first one is in sentence. And then the next year entitle. I would say just make it all title for this page just to keep it. in line

Tyler Wright: Zach do you feel strongly about this colon right here?

Zach Horn: He has to make that a period good call up.

Tyler Wright: We need to add lip.

Zach Horn: a couple of Cosmos Yeah,…

Tyler Wright: I need to have wait.

Zach Horn: go outside.

Tyler Wright: I was just gonna say we need to have leak wallet here.

Zach Horn: Yes. Yes could call up.

Zach Horn: And that should get ordered as Kepler and then leap, excuse me.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: Okay, it's going down.

Zach Horn: wow, is that real time?

Denis Lelic: Yes.

Zach Horn: Wow, that's very cool. So it's updating that timestamp there. 15 23 GMT. Yeah. Wow. That's very cool.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, this is all the data pulling from cloud mods.

Tyler Wright: This point from coin it says it's playing from coin gecko.

Zach Horn: Got it.

Denis Lelic: yeah. That's right.

Zach Horn: fine

Tyler Wright: I guess we have data point from Tuesday replaces. It's not a problem because if we go, so right now I know it could be two different times right now. It says 269 If I go to network activity, okay, so it's 269 so good.

Tyler Wright: I just looked on coin market cap and it's 272.

Zach Horn: classes

Tyler Wright: So I'm who cares right?

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I did the same. just checking.

Zach Horn: Yeah. Geckos are 270. So all the exchanges are just a little all over the place. But

Tyler Wright: Yeah. Yeah, sorry where we were akt token when token metrics.

Zach Horn: the G and Geico needs to be capitalized

Zach Horn: This whole section is fine that copies pulling from the previous site, which was just written. So that's all good. main features

Tyler Wright: Okay, excellent.

Zach Horn: that's from the previous site. I remember writing that. Main features. Yeah, that's fine. I can't see.

Tyler Wright: Same thing with the semicolon or do you want to keep it?

Zach Horn: No, make it a period.

Zach Horn: Drop down that first. Thank you.

Zach Horn: Okay, so that needs to be updated.

Denis Lelic: I think this is the content from the existing website. I'm not sure let me check.

Zach Horn: Okay, so those content is not been written for any of those. So we need to update.

Zach Horn: this is a very minor point so I let's talk about on it, but I would vote that opening a new FAQ does not close the previous FAQ that you're on sometimes you want to see more than one of those at one time.

Tyler Wright: I would agree with that.

Denis Lelic: boots

00:55:00

Tyler Wright: and maybe this is a lot but I feel like when you open these things traditionally you get a plus sign and then it changed it to a minus sign and when you hit the minus sign it goes back down or is that Just this design.

Denis Lelic: yeah, I think that was working previously.

Zach Horn: That's correct.

Denis Lelic: I'm sure I've checked that but maybe they've

Denis Lelic: done something that it's not working. Okay.

Zach Horn: But otherwise that should be it for this page.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, that's it.

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Denis Lelic: One more thing I've added. We're missing on the left vertical navbar. We're missing akt 2.0 features.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: So I just added that.

Denis Lelic: Okay, so development now, right?

Tyler Wright: Yep.

Zach Horn: I think I'll go back to that previous page quickly.

Zach Horn: scroll up to you need a zero on price there.

Denis Lelic: Okay.

Denis Lelic: maybe that's something from coin gecko, but I'm just gonna know it here.

Zach Horn: yeah, I wouldn't let it be a blocker but Let's see if we can fix that.

Zach Horn: kill the exclamation point in the first line

Zach Horn: We need to just be a little less excited about that.

Denis Lelic: Just imagine someone with a strong German accent screaming that.

Zach Horn: That's right. The diverse people users

Zach Horn: This is one of those things where I can't remember if I wrote this or not.

Tyler Wright: Yes, if you did write it,…

Zach Horn: Okay.

Tyler Wright: the only thing I will say as nicely as possible is in the last line it says.

Tyler Wright: All aspects of the cash network from code to culture or managed by the community with our like and divide it into three programs, which I don't know what that means.

Zach Horn: You have no idea what that means either just kill it.

Zach Horn: Nobody knows what it means or this provocative.

Denis Lelic: So we removed the explanation mark do we add a period there?

Zach Horn: Yes.

Denis Lelic: And what are we kicking out which part of I missed that.

Zach Horn: And everything from and divided to the end of the sentence.

Denis Lelic: And divided, okay.

Tyler Wright: yeah, so just ended at Community just period kill the rest

Zach Horn: Was it for that page?

Tyler Wright: no, no, I was just looking at it because

Tyler Wright: I think about this for some time. But when you go to development page and then you met with the open source community in the cigs and working groups. It doesn't really tell you where to go to actually get involved in development. And then you go to the Community page and it's more focus on The Insider stuff, which I understand is more like Adam focused but I would argue that the cigs and…

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: working groups are at the heart of the community initiatives, so I don't know if this page needs to Have a different header again. It's not necessarily A blocker because I like the content of this page, but I'm just thinking about call to action.

01:00:00

Zach Horn: Yeah, I agree to completely. I would say let's not let it be a blocker but we should Circle back for the first update on this to explain how here it is get started with contributing scroll down. What does this say?

Denis Lelic: Yeah, if you use the menu on the left, it's going to jump to these sections but this is the content.

Zach Horn: God

Denis Lelic: Greg created a year ago or…

Zach Horn: okay.

Denis Lelic: 

Tyler Wright: So maybe we can move this getting started with contributing to the top right here.

Zach Horn: Yes.

Denis Lelic: after this one

Zach Horn: Get started needs to be above the fold for sure.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, so, yeah, We can make the top section right here after and then maybe we need to even make this section the community groups and special interest groups. Or maybe the community groups can be above it because it's just like you like to learn how to Country can't contribute and then you just get met with this calendar, which I think is The calendar is great. No problem with the calendar, but it's just like what is all this,

Zach Horn: exactly

Denis Lelic: So getting started a section goes above the calendar.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I would say community groups should go about the calendar. And then you can put the calendar and then you can talk about special interest groups and working groups if you want to and the steering committees and committees.

Zach Horn: Tails and that section needs to be even more direct because at the moment it's very scroll up to get started. Is very abstract and a little intellectual it needs to be extremely straightforward of if you landed on this page and you want to contribute in any of these areas join a Sig group introduce yourself and we'll get you started because I agree with your point that excuse me.

Zach Horn: Man, I'm gonna call today. It needs to be super straight Board of join us a group. We will get you placed in started because that's the first point that we want to engage with people. So that needs to be even more clear and…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: that get started to contributing. But for now, let's just put it above the fold and we can come back to it.

Tyler Wright: Other than that, what I would do here is instead of linking to the projects list because this is outdated. I would have us linked to the projects board.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's a good call.

Denis Lelic: Okay.

Tyler Wright: And I would have them here. I'll send you a I'll drop the link in the chat, but I would just have a link to the general projects board so that if they want to learn more about what's happening on product engineering side if they want to learn more about what's happening on the community and marketing side, especially with a bounties. They can do that too. So instead of the link that you have in there. It should link to that right there.

Tyler Wright: To see a list of projects being worked on or under construction C. GitHub projects and then

Tyler Wright: to be honest I gave access to piece yesterday to start transferring all the code and structure over to the new Akash organization. It's under the website revamp repo. He has still access once he starts moving over the code. I might myself to start looking in here and start updating this copy. I will not touch anything that Zach has already touched because he's a Content King put on record as many times as I can but Pages like this that I think we're Greg made the initial copy. I'm just gonna update it a little bit over the weekend prior to Sunday. And just make new PRS.

Zach Horn: I appreciate that time. Let's get that on record as many times as possible.

Denis Lelic: Are we recording this?

Zach Horn: Yeah, yeah, that's right.

Tyler Wright: this I love A lot and I feel like should be referenced higher up.

Zach Horn: same

Tyler Wright: And again I'll update this. But when you look at the special interest group working groups YouTube groups and about in the section above. And the welcome section I guess.

Tyler Wright: yeah, That's a live there too. But I love this.

01:05:00

Zach Horn: Yeah, I agree with you on that.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: This section should be much more highlighter than it is pretty buried at the…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: A small point I would kill CG and in the title. We're suffering from a little bit of acronym overload.

Tyler Wright: Yes.

Zach Horn: Some of these are necessary, but I would Get rid of that one.

Tyler Wright: I would agree with that. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Current projects again this in my opinion should link to the project boards.

Denis Lelic: I just one thing. Sorry the current groups.

Tyler Wright: yeah.

Denis Lelic: Any action items here?

Tyler Wright: no action items

Denis Lelic: And all of these tiles all are actually clickable.

Zach Horn: Yeah, I don't think so.

Denis Lelic: So when you hover this should be like an indicator which is a shadow and a highlight of I think the name should color in red. So if you click on one of these It's gonna take you to the notes and all the stuff. I think the whole.

Tyler Wright: I guess I go ahead.

Zach Horn: could you

Zach Horn: Really quickly is. Could you border Shadow is something we're going to need to Circle back on the blog. I was looking at that this morning you just reminded me.

Denis Lelic: What do you mean exactly?

Zach Horn: So on each of those cards if you go back. Each of them has Is that a five or ten pixel border shadow? We need those on the blog cards and…

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: they're not there currently.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, that's something we grabbed from Greg. I remembered because when he was working on it, he wanted everything completely flat. but We can add that I think you…

Zach Horn: okay.

Zach Horn: I'm a big fan of Border Shadow myself,…

Denis Lelic: I

Denis Lelic: Think it's not going to be an issue.

Zach Horn: and that is a hill. I will dial.

Denis Lelic: There is a slight zoom on the blog post. photographic Which comes from tailwind and…

Zach Horn: mmm

Denis Lelic: this here is a custom tile.

Denis Lelic: So we would just need to customize that Tailwind component for the blog post and add a drop shadow, but I would suggest we do that in round two.

Tyler Wright: What? are

Zach Horn: okay, let's Circle back on that when we talk about the blog…

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: because I may want to push for that in the first one, but Let's Circle back. Let's just keep going for now.

Tyler Wright: in terms of working groups. Where is this data being pulled from is this something that will have to be added manually in this section. The only reason why I'm asking is because the cigs they all look good the None of these are working groups anymore. I guess there was at one point, but I think this is a placeholder information. So I believe the user groups and the working groups. Need to be removed. These three I can populate it if we need to. with other ones But at least these three from working group section and these two from User Group sections should be removed.

Denis Lelic: Okay, there are no user groups.

Tyler Wright: There are user groups, but there's no user group meetings. There's a Discord that we could take people to especially for mining or something. But these two are not them user group for analytics. There's no user group for blockchain. There's no working group for Community. There was a working group for docs 2.0 and there was a working group for economics 2.0 but it's never happened or akt 2.0, but there's never had a meeting. So I think these just need to be replaced with working group or Akash website working group easily. There's a couple of others that we have more consistently and then for user groups, I would add mining. Also for steering committee. I don't know where this information is coming from but this time is wrong and so is this monthly on the second it should be on the last Thursday of the month.

Denis Lelic: Okay, let me just write that down.

Zach Horn: Also that they're copy needs to change the monthly on the second Thursday. That's not legible.

Denis Lelic: what about other meetings?

Tyler Wright: They all have the same time and date.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Okay.

Tyler Wright: at least for the top sections. It looks like it's populating. All right. Let's see supervisors.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, this is part.

Zach Horn: Ty go back to that Go back.

Tyler Wright: Sorry.

Zach Horn: for that section The second Wednesday of every month that's good. The ones that say monthly on the second need to change and then there's ones that say the number four Wednesday of every they all need to standardize just whichever number in the format of second whichever day of the month.

01:10:00

Denis Lelic: so standardized

Tyler Wright: Okay, I can focus on that. I can do that one. So just put that next to my name and…

Zach Horn: Sounds good.

Tyler Wright: I can look to edit that before Sunday. That's a great call out.

Zach Horn: Yeah, sounds good.

Tyler Wright: like it this might

Zach Horn: Hey guys. give me 30 seconds. I'll be right back.

Tyler Wright: Yeah This is for you right now at the very least all these user groups. These five are all linking. To it looks like placeholder copy. Because it looks like the dates are the same. The leadership is all Scott Carruthers. And then if I go back and…

Denis Lelic: All these groups are linking to the same.

Tyler Wright: go to another.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, yeah.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I wrote All user groups are linking to the same placeholder content.

Denis Lelic: What about the working groups?

Tyler Wright: 

Denis Lelic: What about the working groups?

Tyler Wright: It's all linking to some placeholder thing. It's all linking to community Sig. I think

Tyler Wright: let me see. wrecking groups

Tyler Wright: No, it's all linking the header is consistent, but the body. Copy is all just placeholder.

Zach Horn: Okay.

Denis Lelic: I'm gonna add we need to pull data from GitHub.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, exactly.

Denis Lelic: Okay.

Zach Horn: Good.

Tyler Wright: current projects this should link to the project board this information. I'm not saying we kill this page. Because this is 2023 but this is this archive information. Maybe we shouldn't put on the website because it's just Not accurate, but this should link to the project boards.

Denis Lelic: Which one exactly?

Zach Horn: The model is gone.

Tyler Wright: this entire section, so maybe we should have a current projects and then maybe one should be product and Engineering board and the other one should be community and marketing Board and they'll link to This page right here if you can see it. And then maybe if we can drop in it can link to it's basically needs a link to this right because this is all the work that's happening on the project and product and Engineering side. And this is all the work that's publicly facing on the Marketing and Community side. So it's a link to this project section.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Or specifically if there's a way that we could embed each of these on a screen. That would be not that too so that it lives. Here somewhere.

Tyler Wright: Let me know when you want to move on.

Denis Lelic: I just rolled like we need to link to Akash cohesive put product map or what. Is it Akash cohesive product. something

Tyler Wright: He's a product of engineering roadmap.

Denis Lelic: right and

Tyler Wright: Zach do you feel strongly like one says Akash community and marketing initiatives other ones says products and Engineering roadmap. Should we make them both say roadmap?

Zach Horn: it's

Zach Horn: there was a reason we didn't.

Zach Horn: that said Maybe we should know you make a good point and…

Tyler Wright: We don't have to.

01:15:00

Zach Horn: I'm weighing. Whether it should just change it. Let's leave them the way they are for now, but that's a good point and let's Circle back on it.

Tyler Wright: Okay, cool.

Tyler Wright: So we'll leave them as it's so again folks should be linking to this tab. to that project boards for this section the current projects

Denis Lelic: So none of these three sections like list of project States is not relevant anymore.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: No, we got rid of those. I think at the November we like face without the November or October during committee meeting.

Denis Lelic: Okay, so all of this.

Tyler Wright: this is fine because this is the 2003 2023. if you want to put this what did we do in 2023 past? Projects or something, like all I don't know.

Denis Lelic: not

Zach Horn: I have a high level thought because we have a lot of website left to go this whole page needs what I would call a comprehensive redesign essentially it needs to be repositioned entirely. It's fine for now. But I would suggest we just skim these things for extremely obvious things that need to be fixed for V1. And then we pretty quickly get on to community ecosystem blog Etc.

Tyler Wright: cool

Denis Lelic: got it. product strategy is pretty much the content from

Zach Horn: Yeah. This is fine.

Denis Lelic: existing website

Zach Horn: As long as there's no glaring like spelling errors or extremely obvious things. I say we keep rolling.

Tyler Wright: I agree.

Denis Lelic: Yeah Are there any available bounties?

Tyler Wright: yeah, I would link if we could just link out to This page right here. Then we can just kill this page. I'm gonna drop in the chat for Inside the community and marketing board. We have a page that is dedicated to bounties. And it has active bounties out there and what's completed my vote is we just link people to this page so that people can see the bounties. Maybe if Zach feel strongly we can have some header copy that says bounties.

Zach Horn: Yeah. The one thing that I do feel strongly about is that the page on the website currently is aspirational.

Tyler Wright: We're always looking for bounties if you want to get involved and just like a little header and then link people to that page.

Zach Horn: I mean, yes, it would be great to have a page on the website that keeps track of active bounties. I don't think we're at a place where we can keep that updated. So yes, I would say link out to GitHub will keep GitHub updated and let's keep the website lean.

Denis Lelic: Okay action item. Should we just add a button that links to this one?

Zach Horn: For now, yeah.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: And we'll get rid of all this copy down to this contribution guidelines and rewards all that we can get rid of from that.

Denis Lelic: Can you just switch to the website? what about These guidelines and…

Tyler Wright: Oops. I thought it was yeah.

Denis Lelic: and so on. Is that something we need or

Tyler Wright: We can cut it for now. I think we can add those copy back later, but let's cut this section from the

Denis Lelic: so we completely remove bounties or from the website

Tyler Wright: we will come up with maybe one or two lines of body copy that go there and then we'll just put a button that button will be the button. that link. I just put in the chat and I'll link to the GitHub.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's correct. The content for this page was created. A nice way to say would be aspirationally we've essentially completely retool their Bounty programs. So yes with Ty just said a couple lines of copy button will Circle back at some point and…

Tyler Wright: presentation

Zach Horn: fill us out with the way that we actually do that is now

Zach Horn: Okay funding.

Denis Lelic: Here's the governance proposal and the button just links to the best practices. I think Adam posted that on the GitHub. Just something.

Denis Lelic: Community members or anyone trying to be involved with this kind of funding can just grab have a look and read through the document.

01:20:00

Zach Horn: Denis I like that there are four different responses in your graphic there.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Denis right now. It links to just a discussions. I just dropped in the check.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, it's a wrong link.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I just added the updated link that I should link to in the chat.

Denis Lelic: In figma, it's the right length, but here is the wrong one governance proposal.

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Zach Horn: the body copying these sections is weighted a little strangely, but I don't think that's anything we need to stress on right…

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: This is so buried.

Denis Lelic: It happens, in some of the previous actions. We just went through…

Zach Horn: Yeah. definitely

Denis Lelic: but we can fix that later.

Zach Horn: Yeah, let's Circle back on it. Okay.

Denis Lelic: And this grants program? I think I've shared it.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: I don't know if I shared it with both of you guys. and Slack It's just like the grand program.

Tyler Wright: Yes.

Denis Lelic: It's something we discussed. During our meetings and Tyler I'm not sure maybe you've mentioned some of Where users can present their ideas, but they don't want to go through creating a governance proposal. One example is for Pierce where he just wants to play around with. I don't know AI deployments but needs a couple of hundreds of kt. To fund that deployment and the experiment so you don't want to go through the hassle of creating a governance proposal. And that's for the grants is Right. Basically just for smaller things and

Denis Lelic: posting ideas

Tyler Wright: No, I like this. I think this needs to be built out a lot because we don't have a form of program right now. But to Zach's point for the sake of us getting it going. I'm fine with us. if this goes to a tight form, then I can look at that type form and we can assess and then we'll just update this copy over time because we might have a micro grants program. We might do a Grant's program over time. But we'll make it very specific.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I'm sure the type form and…

Tyler Wright: But for now, I think this is fine.

Denis Lelic: if you think it's okay, you can just publish it and we can add it there to the button.

Tyler Wright: Cool, but look at that today.

Tyler Wright: All right community.

Zach Horn: Need a lot more content on this page across the board.

Tyler Wright: Yeah a great.

Denis Lelic: yeah, it's

Tyler Wright: I like this.

Tyler Wright: I like the events tab. I like the Akash. Edu this is fine. Obviously console whatever we can just keep it for now.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, one question regarding the EDU. None of these are real. So that's just something appears, but there.

Denis Lelic: And I was wondering what edu stuff is currently. live

Tyler Wright: We can link this to omniflix.

Denis Lelic: yeah, I think I shared it with you on just here it is.

Denis Lelic: Is this the right one?

Tyler Wright: Yes.

Denis Lelic: So we just link one to that thing.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I would just link all of them to that thing.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, but you're gonna end up in the same thing. So it's kind of misleading.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I think that's fine. I think if you click on here because on edu if you click on cloudmos, you click on pre-tour if you click on the console, I think it should take you to the same area and omniplex which is left an idea. But omniplex that I believe is gate kept they get to test a while and all this kind of stuff. So at least you take them to the area where they can figure out how to do more. Otherwise, I believe Adam didn't even want this on the page,

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: which I disagree with. I think it should go on the page, but I think it needs to just link to the general area where you can figure out next steps for yourself.

01:25:00

Denis Lelic: We have to remove console from here then.

Zach Horn: Yep.

Tyler Wright: Okay, I'm fine with that.

Denis Lelic: Because there's no content for it.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: And okay cool.

Zach Horn: Sounds good.

Denis Lelic: I think this is the actual content. we only got Robert there. So we need to

Tyler Wright: Yeah. Me too.

Zach Horn: I think this is fine for now. Let's just leave it in keep moving.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, same content and we have a button up there.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: This is what is that wrap up section at the bottom.

Denis Lelic: It's a wrap up.

Zach Horn: Wrap up hits my ear a little strangely, but I think it's fine.

Tyler Wright: This is another page that over the weekend. I'm just gonna go in there once it's like in the website revamp repo and I'm probably going to edit the copy.

Zach Horn: So good.

Denis Lelic: Can you just check the swag shop?

Tyler Wright: The link doesn't work. Okay.

Denis Lelic: Is it working? Okay.

Tyler Wright: Is that button supposed to be the link What is it? Is it the button?

Denis Lelic: It's like a shop icon or something.

Tyler Wright: Got you, kind of looks like a calendar.

Zach Horn: Yeah. The design language on that is a little weird.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: That's Not to put that on you Dennis, but it's like a gigantic button and…

Denis Lelic: I'm not sure…

Zach Horn: then a left aligned link.

Denis Lelic: if I made that but I think it's coming up from Tailwind. But my suggestion would be we do this in round two and we can just have one menu item dedicated to swag shot and…

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: we can just present it with a cool photo and then some copy and a link to this Workshop.

Tyler Wright: I love that.

Zach Horn: I'm with you on all that done as I can't say how many times I do that where I look at something. It's like was that me?

Denis Lelic: Okay, I would never write.

Zach Horn: Canon exactly I would never do that. no, I did.

Tyler Wright: All right ecosystem.

Zach Horn: All right. This looks fine. let's keep it. console Akash parade or yeah.

Denis Lelic: The lengths need to be updated. So I've wrote it in figma. All of the links need to be updated.

Tyler Wright: I talk about for community.

Denis Lelic: No, no the ecosystem page. awesome,…

Tyler Wright: Okay, cool. Yeah, all the links need to be.

Denis Lelic: Akash Prater And it's not console. It's cloudmos.

Denis Lelic: This is okay.

Zach Horn: Hey, Denis,…

Denis Lelic: This is okay.

Zach Horn: go back real quick. we saw you made that logo for xdxl, which I do like. how do you feel this is backstory, but when we made that out. That was just the working title that ended up sticking because it was kind of catchy. Do you think that we should change that Essentially the same logo you have there on the left. So xdxl after the logo and…

Denis Lelic: yeah, I was like Yeah,…

Zach Horn: just rename the app as well,…

Denis Lelic: I was thinking about that when I did like Akash stats,…

Zach Horn: .

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: and another thing. And I was just thinking as the Excel is really not in line with all of the others. It could be like akashics as the Excel or something.

Zach Horn: totally

Tyler Wright: If I hear the question,…

Zach Horn: what about This can be a V2 thing because I…

Denis Lelic: Or gen image or something.

Zach Horn: I don't think we should smell Exactly. an overarching title that captures multiple models. I think we should Rebrand it. But let's keep moving. We don't have to do that right now.

Tyler Wright: I have one I like these headers. I wonder

Tyler Wright: so we put tools before showcase. and the only reason why I asked that because I feel showcases on and these two things are prominent another section and I feel like we're not even going in alphabetical order

01:30:00

Tyler Wright: but you just want to put it out there and we need to add clouds here.

Denis Lelic: Yeah I wrote it in figma console out called Mosin,…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: but I would avoid alphabetical order and I would personally prefer to focus on what's more important. maybe showcase at this point not that much but in a bigger plan, we can add more items here and I don't know create a case study for Sample Ai, and it's going to be an article or something.

Tyler Wright: I love that.

Zach Horn: Yeah, definitely.

Tyler Wright: All right. I

Denis Lelic: We found a lot of stuff During the day I posted a bunch of comments.

Tyler Wright: yeah.

Denis Lelic: That's why is probably missing. So we have three pages now of action items.

Tyler Wright: Do we want to move on to it? Looks like the provider stuff is good become a provider links to that page. active audited Cool.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: And this is cool.

Tyler Wright: Do we want to Go ahead.

Denis Lelic: It's live data as well,…

Denis Lelic: which is great.

Tyler Wright: yeah, I like the Do we want to go to block?

Zach Horn: it so Thinking out loud.

Tyler Wright: I'll go ahead go ahead Zach.

Zach Horn: You have ecosystem and where do you go here? this is the main page nice. wait.

Tyler Wright: Hey.

Zach Horn: Where do you land on when you hit ecosystem in the nav?

Denis Lelic: help to

Tyler Wright: You can't land on tools.

Zach Horn: Okay, that's kind of why do you land on the second before?

Denis Lelic: yeah. good point

Zach Horn: That's odd? So you land on tools showcase deployed providers and then if You tab over to providers? You get that? Okay, that's pretty buried. We should surface this way higher because this is an excellent page.

Denis Lelic: Which one is buried?

Zach Horn: This page then we're on providers.

Denis Lelic: providers So if you want to prioritize which one would be first second third fourth.

Zach Horn: this is gonna sound crazy. I wouldn't even be opposed to putting this in the nav.

Tyler Wright: 

Zach Horn: If we don't want to do that. I would say.

Denis Lelic: I would go round to I don't know disagree, but I would say around to. but still…

Zach Horn: Yeah, sounds good.

Denis Lelic: if you have had to prioritize you land where showcase

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's a good question. Yes do showcase for where you land and then we'll just leave this as it is for now.

Zach Horn: On the scale or on the topic of things. We need to come back to go back to the provider page, please.

Tyler Wright: Which this one or the other one? How the hell do I even get to it?

Zach Horn: the other one Yeah.

Zach Horn: The cost providers just in the other tab. that's exactly what I'm talking about.

Denis Lelic: Ecosystem and then you just switch between items in the second map. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: this one.

Zach Horn: So that's actually an excellent demonstration there because if you just had that heart of a time getting to it. Nobody's gonna find it.

Tyler Wright: Sorry, I was even confused I was confused but I mean the network like the provider page, the other one.

Tyler Wright: You don't talk about development. Anyway, there was another.

Zach Horn: I think We're uncovering a bit of a latent navigation issue here.

Tyler Wright: yeah, there was a

Denis Lelic: You have to go to network about and…

Zach Horn: I think.

Denis Lelic: then you'll find providers. Here, yeah.

Tyler Wright: there's another one that's like becoming a provider here this.

Denis Lelic: That's get started. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: Yeah but since that's provided so this will be this page and looks like we'll be network slash providers.

Denis Lelic: That's in the URL.

Tyler Wright: I mean in the URL right now, it's Akash human dot digital. So I'd have to imagine that you replace the human digital with DOT Network and this will be network slash providers. On this page,…

Denis Lelic: Okay.

Tyler Wright: it would also be great to have that graphic. So it's like blatant, but this whole

Zach Horn: We'll see then than that. It's an entire interactive page in my opinion that the page of the interactive real-time info needs to be slash providers.

Tyler Wright: yeah exit.

Zach Horn: This one needs to be slash become a provider or something.

Denis Lelic: Or get started slash become a provider or something. Because there's a set another page between the homepage and…

01:35:00

Tyler Wright: Probably yeah.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Denis Lelic: this one. But I'm not sure, maybe that's something. fish and his crew will Arrange when they're transferring or everything into the repo and they're gonna set up domains there.

Zach Horn: Denis can you note something and this can be for me too? And this is everywhere. This is across the entire network. We need readable names for these providers. the way that we do it P of the r name. it's workable, but That's been a long time frustration and…

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: it's in all our deployment tools. It's here we need clean readable names for these providers.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, that's something. I haven't joined but it's part of the provider attribute. And I'm not sure if that functionality is there so if no one is grabbing and providers are not providing a name a proper name not just a link we can display anything…

Zach Horn: I see.

Denis Lelic: but here I've come up with something else to have at least some sort of identification for the providers which is let's grab two letters from the link which is something Google does if you don't provide a profile pic. So at least there's some differentiation between them.

Zach Horn: Yep.

Denis Lelic: So hey you I know this one. It's the Euro plots. So

Zach Horn: Yeah, that sounds good.

Denis Lelic: But yeah.

Zach Horn: But We don't have to get bogged down on it. But yes, that's Something we need to come back to I like to work around that.

Denis Lelic: I think Tyler has more information about attributes.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, that's a whole another thing. So I would have you join that meeting…

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I know.

Tyler Wright: but we're not fairly close on that. One thing. I do want to comment on and this is a question. and the network, we have Is it possible in the community to have a drop-down one of the dropdowns could be Akash insiders and it can kind of be another page could be providers and it takes you to provider page which has that graphic and a bunch of other information on it. because I just want to make it easier for somebody to that go so Casa to become a provider rather than the only place I can do that right now is I understand is that they get started. And then they can become and…

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I agree with you. but if you have a look at the existing website Greg Purposefully created everything without a drop down.

Tyler Wright: they can.

Tyler Wright: put

Denis Lelic: That's something he He wants and he likes and he doesn't want to hide anything in a drop-down. but yeah, so we inherited that stuff in this website as well, but Maybe for round two maybe we can the website is growing. We just can't Stack Up. items there and I would personally prefer to have a drop down and you directly go to the page you want without Having to click multiple times to find something.

Tyler Wright: the only other thing I could say is we add more buttons in this nav bar and instead of get started could be one button, but really it's like Become a provider. You can click that Deploy on akash, you click that and it'll at least take you the two different paths that you want to go. You…

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: because I can't if I want to become a provider. I don't know. I'm saying and we don't have really a search bar. So only way I know is I get started, but maybe I don't want to get started as a deploy. I don't know. That's just something I just wanted to call out.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: It's a good call out. We're getting back into where we were Almost a year ago. Where we need to Define personas and then we need to walk through from each persona. This has been on the back burner for a very long time. So let's table it but I agree we need to walk through the site from essentially. I'm a provider. I have Computer Resources. I want to bring them online. How do I do that? And you land on the homepage is a legible to know…

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: where to go and then the same for pretends for everybody. So let's table for right now.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: We can come back to

Tyler Wright: cool so blog

Zach Horn: yes. Yes indeed Okay, so Same change for the dates that we talked about previously five men read. with that single dot separator Otherwise everything on this page looks pretty clean if you click search. Let's go back up. What happens? Okay, it's pretty good. Start typing something like type super antenna. Yeah, okay. What?

01:40:00

Zach Horn: Nice, that's great.

Zach Horn: So if we get out of that.

Zach Horn: Yeah, same things we talked about remove the period fix the date. Titles are cards. Look good. right. This is what I was talking about with the Border Shadow. I understand the way you guys are doing cards here that may not work. But if you're gonna have the hover State, hover states. That was the whole thing. So if you hover, Exhuming the image. I don't love that personally. I don't like the image being disconnected from the border. This is kind of a minor thing. I don't think we need to hold ourselves up for V1. I would prefer the image stay Link to the border and then the whole card hovers with a border shadow.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, the thing is we would have to customize the card because if we drop a shadow now for example, on the left side. the Border would align completely with the text because the text is left aligned to the edge of the card which means we had to add some of the margins padding and stuff like that which Require us to customize the card,…

Zach Horn: I say

Denis Lelic: but I think that's possible. and we can do it in around here and we can just Define What's the best?

Zach Horn: yeah.

Denis Lelic: Experience to have on these tiles and we just apply it across the website.

Zach Horn: Round two for Let's jump into a blog posts. Probably one of the new ones.

Zach Horn: Okay, so yeah cropping issues.

Zach Horn: Formatting looks good. I like the link highlighting.

Zach Horn: Jump into gosh which posted text blocks or code blocks? Go back to the index

Zach Horn: Do the first one? this is an updated.

Tyler Wright: this one

Zach Horn: I see now that the featured post.

Tyler Wright: Yeah,…

Zach Horn: the

Tyler Wright: I was gonna say that seemed like a lot of posts are missing.

Zach Horn: There are yeah this isn't up to date.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: But do the first one. at the very top Now thought about it.

Tyler Wright: this one

Zach Horn: Yeah, yeah.

Zach Horn: Scroll down I'm trying to find There are code blocks in the new posts that aren't on this site and I'm thinking that there aren't gonna be okay. why wouldn't this content be up today?

Denis Lelic: And good call I made a note here.

Zach Horn: Yeah. I'm just curious how that would even happen because he should be pulling from GitHub. Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Zach Horn: Okay.

Zach Horn: Otherwise looks clean. I like it.

Denis Lelic: so any notes for the code Snippets? Do we have an example here?

Zach Horn: I would love to yeah, I don't think we have an example because the contents not up today.

Denis Lelic: Not even some from the old ones.

Zach Horn: And I was trying to remember if there are any I can't remember off hand. We could scroll through them real quick. there we go.

Denis Lelic: Okay, I think this. Is a bit weird.

Zach Horn: Looks pretty good A little I think that's content of it's doing that weird markdown formatting. right

Denis Lelic: It's formatted that this way.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, because it's supposed to be like you should be able to copy these blocks, This is that. So this may be terminology.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's right.

Zach Horn: Going to that IP leases post.

Denis Lelic: No, it's not there.

Zach Horn: No, okay.

Tyler Wright: All right, so I guess we need to see the status of where the blogs are right now Is there a specific blog that he should get online so that we can test it as soon as possible?

01:45:00

Zach Horn: Yeah, all of us the answer that question the

Zach Horn: this one or the drop a link.

Zach Horn: There's only a couple that are reflected here. But this is the one that has the code blocks.

Denis Lelic: I think the code blocks are gonna look the same as they look in the docs. They should look the same.

Zach Horn: Here, yeah. I feel like I saw them during a demonstration at one point.

Tyler Wright: Yeah.

Zach Horn: I think they look good, but just wanted to check those but If we can now,…

Tyler Wright: for sure.

Zach Horn: that's fine. I think this looks good. Let's do the docs because I know there's a couple on that page.

Zach Horn: Okay, so right out the bat we need to. Eng notes, I don't love let's go and just spell out engineering.

Zach Horn: That's not like we're a part up for space about. section

Zach Horn: Need a little bit of a refactor on that body cop explore the world of Akash or comprehensive documentation offering tutorials. Richard pository of platform insights the double period That's a recurring thing. I'm not quite sure why that keeps that coming up. But yeah single period please. explain the world of Akash. S I'll come up with a rewrite for that. Essentials tokens and…

Tyler Wright: 

Zach Horn: wallets sdl common questions. I like Essentials. I don't know that those are the essentials but Maybe we can pinpoint that go to common questions.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's not good. Go back.

Denis Lelic: And it's also said monetize your Cloud resources. the condom is not right. But I remember in the previous docs common questions their work common.

Zach Horn: that's right.

Denis Lelic: Common questions, but I'm not sure if the new dogs 2.0. has been

Zach Horn: So here's the thing that's going through my mind. I like Essentials as a section like that is a good idea. Common question should be FAQ, but FAQ is not essential so I think we're just a little disjointed in General on this section.

Zach Horn: Go to sdl real quick.

Denis Lelic: yeah.

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Zach Horn: Customers' tenants. customers. It's a get changed to find deployment services.

Zach Horn: That's been using it simplified significantly

Zach Horn: But okay for now we can come back to that. so if you go back so essentially we have Essentials and that's dumping you into the docks kind of in the middle-ish. Go back to the doc's home. Yeah.

Zach Horn: Okay, this is going to need some work. I don't know what needs to be V1 for this one needs to be V2 because I don't want to block our launch here. I want this thing. I want to say a lot. So we have Essentials then we have Cloud must CLI stable payment deployments. What happens if you go there?

Zach Horn: Got it.

Denis Lelic: And the icon is wrong.

Zach Horn: Which I kind of. you're saying that should not in fact be a question mark

Zach Horn: almost Go to that real quick. I must deploy.

Zach Horn: this is all too intellectual, but I think we're getting let's table that but could have been in that to go back.

Zach Horn: Okay, so Essentials deployments providers?

Tyler Wright: to your point

Zach Horn: Deploy application is under providers. That's pretty strange. Greater provider build app that needs to go to access high performance reviews.

Denis Lelic: It's the type form I think yeah.

Zach Horn: That doesn't make any sense. Okay?

Zach Horn: and then that goes intro Akash Network do that flow again real quick. Go back to the docs home.

01:50:00

Zach Horn: So you go Doc's home Let's go down to the bottom of that page and then you hit Akash Network and that takes you to get started intro to akash akash. And then that's a common questions. how to use Akash

Tyler Wright: This Is Us This sectionally pulled from the current documentation. I linked it.

Zach Horn: Okay.

Tyler Wright: So I think he just had a dead Link in the common questions area.

Zach Horn: Got How to use What is the Akash compute Marketplace keep strong.

Tyler Wright: All right.

Zach Horn: How do I use? different

Denis Lelic: so these are Essentials actually like

Zach Horn: right

Zach Horn: What is okay this text highlighting Is that markdown in the underlying content or…

Tyler Wright: Yeah, that's marked down.

Zach Horn: is that? Got it. Okay, that's fine.

Tyler Wright: Any of this copy is coming directly from Scott. So they're just like pulling it in.

Zach Horn: I see.

Tyler Wright: The error that I saw is if you go to home and you go to getting started and let's say you go to deployments. And you go to climos deploy. In the current website because it has all these subsections that are its own page, but the header page is just this. Cloud most deploy and then Akash wants to highlight the spotlight your product your work, but right now because of the way that we're structuring this page, it's out of place the Akash wants a spotlight your work to be down at the bottom of this page.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's right.

Tyler Wright: But below all this Cloud knows but below the instructions.

Zach Horn: Yeah, so go back to that section real quick.

Denis Lelic: How's that happening?

Zach Horn: How's what happens?

Denis Lelic: That Akash wants this Spotlight your work that should be at the end but it's like now the second item on the page.

Zach Horn: That's Legacy.

Tyler Wright: It's happening because it's happening. But yeah, exactly.

Zach Horn: We no, not a tie the background on this I wrote that a long time ago,…

Denis Lelic: Okay.

Zach Horn: and it was put there manually for a whole host of reasons. I agree that you go at the bottom.

Denis Lelic: All right.

Tyler Wright: but It's happening…

Zach Horn: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: because when they pulled in the documents you go to Cloud. Most deploy. And historically we would have these sections at the bottom. And so it fits in right here, but right now…

Zach Horn: right

Tyler Wright: because everything is on one page, it just like is doing an order of operation basically.

Tyler Wright: That make any sense. Yeah.

Zach Horn: It does yeah.

Zach Horn: Okay, So there's a couple things going on here. So we have this doc structure. And then essentially what we've done is we've ported in the existing docs and that's what we're looking at right now. So all of the content in here is basically been lightly reorganized into this new structure, but it's essentially just the existing docs content. Yeah. Okay.

Tyler Wright: Exactly. Yes.

Zach Horn: Quick fix we need to capitalize CLI there. Yep, that's small.

Tyler Wright: Agree, yep.

Zach Horn: So let's not wait into the docs because that's a whole separate thing. If you go to engineering notes. What do you get?

Zach Horn: And just let's fix engineering, please.

Denis Lelic: 

Zach Horn: Go to home. It's one of the world of Akash through our comprehensive documentation offering tutorials on a rich double period again

Tyler Wright: It's the same copy from the docs.

Zach Horn: What's the same copy?

Tyler Wright: You see the cost documentation the same and…

Zach Horn: Yeah. …

Tyler Wright: then you go to engineering notes and it's the same exact account.

Zach Horn: I see there's still a typo engineering though.

Tyler Wright: It's the same exact copy. Yeah. Yeah for sure.

Zach Horn: the biggest word on the page

Zach Horn: Okay, so then if you go to overew. about there on the visualization that needs to be redesigned but that could be a V2.

Tyler Wright: This is all from Scott. So all this is very technical documentation to your point about the regular documentation.

Zach Horn: I see okay.

Zach Horn: right

Tyler Wright: I think we just either need to do one of two things. We need to update this copy. so that

Tyler Wright: So that it's more clear. As to what the engineering docs are or the engineering or it should be consistent right just engineering notes in the headers should be engineering notes right here, but we should make that copy.

Zach Horn: Yeah, that's right. Why? Real quick.

Tyler Wright: This Akashi. Okay.

Zach Horn: Why is it notes in one place and docs and the other?

01:55:00

Tyler Wright: It really should be in it should be.

Zach Horn: I just mean where did notes come from?

Tyler Wright: I had no clue.

Zach Horn: Questions. Okay. let's have a detox.

Denis Lelic: How are we calling it now dogs or…

Zach Horn: docs yes

Denis Lelic: notes? docs, okay

Tyler Wright: ducks

Zach Horn: and even at that let's go documentation.

Zach Horn: Yeah, it's not Edge docs. We'll go with engineering documentation.

Tyler Wright: wait you control this page, Denis because I know everything else is kind of coming in from the current docs, but this is like a new page this Akash documentation like header page

Denis Lelic: Yeah, that's like the intro page that something that also Luna presented. And I know Greg and a couple of other guys liked it. So I just Kept it the functionality and everything. The only thing is we have to Define what are Essentials and then we can just break the other two chapters into deployments and…

Tyler Wright: Okay.

Denis Lelic: providers and provide the most crucial information in those three tiles

Denis Lelic: and Link, of course to the dedicated page in the docs

Tyler Wright: Sounds good.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, also. getting started We have the home page and getting started which is kind of like trying to provide the same information.

Denis Lelic: But getting started is much more.

Zach Horn: the thing Yeah.

Denis Lelic: It's longer and it's maybe providing too much information at one glance. So

Zach Horn: The thing that jumps out of me out of that flow,…

Denis Lelic: what do you

Zach Horn: is that okay? So you go to docs you at home and then now you're getting into the tree there so you get started. then you hit intro that drops down a list. You can't actually click a button…

Denis Lelic: yeah.

Zach Horn: until you're three layers deep. That's not ideal.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, that's something. I wanted to avoid it as well.

Zach Horn: right

Denis Lelic: but I'm not trying to throw any money under the bus. It's not a wrong decision or anything, but I think it's coming from the dogs 2.0 structure.

Zach Horn: Sure.

Denis Lelic: So getting started intro and…

Zach Horn: Okay.

Denis Lelic: then a rest of the items.

Zach Horn: Got it. Okay, let's table it just keep moving. Okay, so we got Zach's are pretty straightforward. We have engineering notes.

Zach Horn: That's about it. I mean we're getting towards the end here. Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: I guess this question the Akash docs are now on the website. I'm saying it should be network slash Docs. But when I look on here you lose a navbar you lose the footer.

Zach Horn: right

Tyler Wright: I'm not really sure how I get back to the website. I guess you have elements of the navbar here, but how do I get back to the homepage?

Zach Horn: Yes, that's good.

Denis Lelic: it's on the right side. Yeah.

Tyler Wright: here here I guess. That's kind of small. Yeah.

Zach Horn: that's not good.

Denis Lelic: It was better before. But then we had to include. engineering Docs

Zach Horn: I have a suggestion here go to Docs.

Denis Lelic: yeah, go ahead.

Zach Horn: What I would like to see and Denis obviously, it's your call on the design. Is the Akash logo in the top left with an arrow next to it that has Akash docs next to that. Which shows you that you were on the homepage now, you're on a cost docs and you just click the Akash level to get back home. I've seen that on a number of sites work pretty well. Yeah.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, we can do that.

Tyler Wright: Yeah. I think that's important for V1.

Zach Horn: Yes. most definitely

Zach Horn: That issue is somewhere else where? Was it the stats page needs a way to.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I think that's something that Max and Denis were working on async yesterday which delayed stats that it cost on network because I think Max is putting in a way to access the home page and the entire nav bar. Correct me from wrong Denis into that stats Page crazy access.

02:00:00

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I think he only had deploying now and Akash stats logo, and I said it's kind of like a dead end when you reach that site. so max is working or maybe it's even done and he's gonna add a car stop networking button. So it kind of takes you back to the website

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I mean again, this is even more imperative because at least with the stats page is the subdomain. This is an ending and it's like we just got lost on our own website on an ending. That's not good.

Zach Horn: that I

Tyler Wright: All I know that we've been going at it for two hours and I really appreciate everyone's time. It sounds like we have a lot of items that you just have to cover. as soon as we're done, As soon as the videos ready, I'm going to put on our weave and send it over to pierce the next hour or two Dennis. Can you have that list ready in the next hour or two before you hop offline? Because I know it's afternoon for you and we can send them a whole list and I mean this is going to require at least on my and to monitor him through the weekend to make sure that we can still launch on Monday.

Tyler Wright: But how are you all feeling? I know there's a number of items. Some Some are larger. Some of them think that we might be able to help with as soon as the website gets moved over to the repo, but there's still fair amount of changes for V1 that I think are necessary. I'm just gonna see where Pierces.

Zach Horn: yeah, I have some thoughts on this. I think we've pretty much wrapped up this meeting. Do you guys want to End the end this meeting and jump into the hollow real quick so we can touch base on a few tactical things. And then I have some other very high priority things. I need to get back to today. How do you feel about that?

Denis Lelic: Yeah, sure.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, that sounds good so much appreciated again the time today,…

Zach Horn: cool

Tyler Wright: we'll make this available as soon as possible. These are again the last items as we look towards launching the revamped website. There's been a lot of work that's gone into the structure design and just obviously backend flow to make it fast open source again and scalable. But again, we just have to finalize these last punch out item before we feel comfortable launching to the general public so much appreciate Zach and Denis for taking the time today, and we'll make this available to push and his team to implement these changes along with a more accurate punch list of all the things that we just talked about in this call today. To get much appreciated everyone's time. And talk on Discord over next day or so as we look to launch the revamped website. Thank you all very much.

Denis Lelic: Thank you.

Zach Horn: Thanks guys. Take care.
