- Piyush shared that he has guidelines ready for community members regarding documentation.
##### Development Page
- Previously, the development page had only one option - overview.
- In the last meeting, jump links were discussed and have now been implemented for easy navigation within the page.
- Current groups are now represented as cards, making it easy to add and manage new cards, such as adding "sig documentation."
- Clicking on a card opens up an overview of the respective group.
- Highlighted the improved management ecosystem for user groups, allowing easy contribution and updates through markdown files.
##### Pricing and Network Activity Page
- Pricing page design has been updated, providing a general comparison overview.

### Providing feedback on completed pages.
- Denis expressed appreciation for the integration of docs into the main page.
- Inquired about completed pages where feedback could be provided.
- Piyush mentioned that the homepage is considered complete and open for feedback.
- Piyush Confirmed that the Community page is complete and open for feedback.
### Verification in the PR Process for Communinity Contributions
- Community contributions are managed through markdown files, with guidelines provided for contributors to add details such as thumbnail image, tag, author name, title, description, and date.
- Tyler expressed appreciation for the ability of community members to add their projects independently, eliminating the need to contact core team members for additions.
- Tyler Suggested the addition of a verification process, potentially in the README of the PR, to ensure the accuracy of information.
- Tyler highlighted the importance of a verification process from an operational standpoint to confirm that projects mentioned in PRs are actually deployed on Akash.
- Piyush confirmed the existence of clear guidelines in the README for PR creation, including a specific format and predefined questions for users to answer.
- Piyush Mentioned the review process, where the core team can assess PRs, provide feedback, and either merge or close them based on adherence to guidelines.
### Completed Pages
- Piyush confirmed that the homepage, ecosystem page, and Community page are functionally complete, with minor UI issues to be addressed.
- Mentioned that the blog page is also complete, with minor issues related to descriptions to be fixed in the next few days.
- Updates on Docs, About, and Token pages are in progress, with UI changes being worked on for the network activity page.
- Zach jotted down the information and asked about the best place to pass new copy for these pages.
- Piyush suggested using Figma for collaboration on copy changes, considering ongoing restructuring and development in the repository.
- Piyush acknowledged the possibility of adding Zach to the repository but advised against it due to the dynamic nature of ongoing changes.
- Suggested alternatives like a Google Sheet for initial copy changes.
- Zach acknowledged the instructions and clarified that he would pass the copy updates to Denis for design integration.
### Explorers on the Website 
- Denis proposed adding a link to explorers on the website, considering it could be part of the network or another relevant section.
- Scott agreed, noting that providing easy access to explorer links is helpful for users familiar with blockchains.
- Piyush suggested placing explorer links on the token page.
- Denis considered either the token page or the network activity page as suitable locations for explorer links.
- Piyush confirmed that adding explorer links would involve a button redirecting to an external page.
- Denis agreed to add the explorer links to the design and tag Piyush for coordination.
### Participation in the Sig Documentation Call
- Tyler informed the team about the Sig documentation call tomorrow, emphasizing the importance of participation. The call will cover the structure and formatting of documentation.
- Tyler outlined that the first part of the conversation will focus on the structure of documentation, and the second part will cover formatting.
- Piyush mentioned that he had already brought up the guidelines for documentation in the current call. He stressed the importance of not altering the tree structure and mentioned that documentation should be simple and easy for new users to navigate.
- Piyush expressed his intention to participate in the Sig documentation call and provide the mentioned guidelines to ensure consistency in the documentation structure.
### Documentation Structure
- Tyler provided context about previous decisions on documentation structure. 
- Tyler highlighted that the community had previously preferred the step-by-step format over a long continuous page.
- Piyush demonstrated the current structure where the left side shows markdown files, and the right side displays the content of the selected file. The right side also allows quick navigation to specific sections.
- Tyler expressed concerns about potential pushback from the community, as some might prefer a step-by-step approach for certain instructions.
- Piyush reassured that the current format is flexible and can accommodate subsections, allowing for step-by-step instructions if needed. Proper guidelines will be shared to maintain consistency.
- Piyush emphasized the importance of following standards while creating content and expressed confidence that community members will adapt to the guidelines
### Developer Documentation
- Tyler highlighted the importance of incorporating developer documentation on the docs home page, considering the need for contributions to the code base in 2024.
- He suggested having a link in the tile section on the docs home page and a secondary menu, possibly above the support section.
- Piyush shared the plan to have two options for users: one for regular user documentation and another for engineering notes, focusing on the technical aspects of contributing to the code base.
- The proposed solution involves a tab switch between user and engineering notes, where the content and tree structures change based on the selected option.
- Zach expressed concern about having multiple trees for different documentation types (user and developer), as it might increase complexity and confusion for users.
- Piyush proposed having a separate tile for "Engineering Notes" instead of tabs, which would change the tree and structure when clicked, keeping it distinct from the regular user documentation.
- Zach emphasized not prioritizing one segment of the user group over another, as both deployers and technical contributors are crucial for the network.
- Tyler highlighted the importance of providing engineering documentation for contributors, such as developers building on top of Akash, and proposed an "Engineering" tile to distinguish this content.
- Tyler emphasized the importance of maintaining a distinction between user-friendly documentation and more technical engineering notes.
- Tyler proposed having both menus live, with a separate "Engineering Notes" section below the main tree.
- Zach suggested consolidating all technical documentation under a top-level header, such as "Advanced Setup" or "Advanced Engineering," and having a tile that jumps to that section.
- Zach expressed concerns about potential confusion when referring to either the Akash documentation or the engineering documentation, suggesting it would be simpler to have a unified Akash docs tree.
- Zach indicated a preference for a unified tree and expressed a willingness to discuss further, either offline or during the Sig docs meeting.
- Zach requested feedback from Denis on whether to have one unified tree or two separate trees for documentation.
- Denis expressed a preference for one tree, emphasizing the challenge of prioritizing users and deciding between deployers, providers, or technical individuals.
- Piyush expressed the need to explore various options and evaluate the available choices.
## Action Items
- Group to provide feedback on the completed pages.
- Zach to initiate copy changes for the completed pages.
