## Meeting Notes
### Documentation Design Options
#### Denis Lelic:
- Previous meeting focused on documentation structure and docs UX.
- Prepared a few options to address this issue.
- Denis Lelic presents options for handling documentation navigation.
- Option 1: Additional navbar similar to how other platforms like Versel handle complex documentation.
  - Denis emphasizes the importance of future scalability without causing issues.
  - Proposes having a dedicated home page for documentation and a separate menu for related topics like engineering notes.
- Option 2: Labels above menu items, similar to YouTube's profile navigation.
  - Denis highlights the usability of labels as anchors for users, making navigation easier.
- Option 3: Labels and groups, with clicks leading to a new page for specific items.
  - Denis notes the advantage of providing a clear overview of items within each group.
  - Acknowledges that this approach might be more suitable for projects with a large number of lengthy items.
### Discussion on Documentation Design Options:
- Piyush expresses preference for the second option due to the simplicity of Akash's structure, suggesting it's more suitable for a maximum of two or three options.
- Zach supports the second option, finding it more organized and efficient for user navigation.
- Zach mentions a slight inclination toward the third option but agrees that further exploration may be needed.
- Tyler appreciates the discussion and suggests setting up a dedicated session for a detailed decision-making process.
- Tyler proposes exploring both options further but deferring the final decision to a later, more extended session.
- Denis emphasizes the importance of having a deeper discussion without necessarily making a decision today.
- Suggests that Piyush explores the technical difficulties and implications of implementing options two or three before the next meeting.
- Piyush stresses the urgency to finalize the decision due to time constraints and explains that option two is more feasible both technically and from a UX standpoint.
- Denis inquires about the potential delay if option three is chosen, and Piyush acknowledges that it might lead to missing the deadline.
- Zach raises the point of setting up for the future and not rushing decisions that could be suboptimal in the long term.
- Tyler agrees with the need for a timely decision but suggests deferring the final decision to a dedicated session on Monday or Tuesday.
- Thomas Greco proposes discussing development-related questions offline, specifically about setting up the IDE and development processes.
- Zach Horn acknowledges Thomas's point about improving clarity in certain sections within the docs from a development perspective.
- Zach Proposes taking the development-related discussion to the Sig docs meeting and suggests discussing it further outside the meeting.
### Discussion on Hero Section:
- Denis Lelic brings up the previous discussion on the hero section, noting community feedback that it doesn't look as great as some others.
- Shares the idea of highlighting the "Super Cloud" and presenting different call-to-action items when users hover over it.
- Denis mentions it's currently a dummy concept and not planned for the first set of updates but could be considered later for a fresh and engaging touch.
- Zach expresses liking the idea, especially considering the site's cleanliness and text-heavy nature.
- Denis adds the possibility of adding interactive elements tied to mouse movement for a more engaging experience.
- Zach Horn approves of the concept and mentions the potential for experimenting with motion in the future.
### Updates on Stats Page ( Website 2.0 )
- Denis informs Piyush that Max from Team Cloudmos is working on the Stats page, and UI refinements will be handled by Max as well.
- Piyush confirms that he has updated the UI structure for the Stats page and will stop further work on it as Max is taking over.
- Denis Lelic clarifies that Max has already started working on the Stats page to avoid duplicating efforts.
- Piyush agrees and mentions that adding a button to the website to link to the Stats page will be a straightforward task.
- Specific details on reaching the page will be communicated by Denis after his next meeting.
- Denis Lelic confirms that the Pricing and Provider pages will remain as they are, and no changes are needed.
- Piyush asks about the subsections on the network activity about section, and Denis assures him that he will provide more information after his next meeting.
## Action Items:
- Group to Consider organizing a dedicated working group session next week to finalize the design direction.
- Zach to bring up the development-related points in the Sig docs meeting for further discussion.
- Group to consider implementing the discussed changes to the hero section in future updates.
- Denis Lelic to provide information on how users will reach the "Stats" page from the website.
