- Tyler suggested creating a structured story or narrative for video production.
- Zach proposed involving Dimokus to do a video(deploy a node through Cloudmos), highlighting its Web3 experience, and asking Jigar to do a video(deploy an AI model through the console)
- Denis pointed out that Jigar had done a demo during a live stream on the mainnet and suggested extracting that content.
