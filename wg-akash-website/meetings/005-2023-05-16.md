Tyler Wright: Yeah, perfect.

Denis Lelic: Got it. So, welcome everybody to I believe this is the fifth. Working Group Session for AKASH website.

Denis Lelic:  We got a couple of things we would like to discuss today. But first of all, I want to give a shout out to Arthur He made some big progress and I think it's the first contribution for Akash website. It's still in review. We still got some stuff. To do to check some. for example, like the mobile version of the website, And how does the dark theme behave? But otherwise great work. We really appreciate your contribution and yeah, I hope will Make the best out of it. Make some great additional pages for for the website because we really need them and maybe we just start off. I was thinking about

Denis Lelic:  Using today's session for. GPU. Testnet Landing page.

Denis Lelic:  Just create a working session to briefly set up the expectations and everything that page should. Consist of. So maybe we just

Denis Lelic: Thought of by.

Denis Lelic:  Kerala. Do you mind if I just write everything down here in this document? And I'll share it later?

Tyler Wright: Sounds good. One thing I want to add, I just want to second with Denis said about Arthur's contributions. One thing that's still being worked on is a more of a structured bounty program around website items documentation. You know Luna's been like a kind of any guinea pig in that with working on docs 2.0 Um, but if anybody has anything that website related that we've already talked about, we've already agreed upon, Please. Make sure it's an issue and then if you're able to do the work on it, put a comment inside the issue that you create.

Tyler Wright:  Has an example, the ecosystem that Akash.network page can be improved and make an issue about that page and what the improvements should be. And then again, it's able to do the work. Put some hours behind that work. And then over the next couple of weeks, we'll we're gonna put some more structure around. What a bounty program could look like. So we can streamline some of these changes and get more contributors like Arthur Luna and others. So I just wanted to note that so that Again, we can talk about, pardon me, we can talk about that in the future. working group session meeting or sick design meeting because again we appreciate the contributions and but like more of them especially as the website is such a big Point for people.

Denis Lelic: yeah, I also had a couple of issues there in Github repo for the website,…

Tyler Wright: Sorry.

Denis Lelic: but all of those issues are outdated. So I think they just auto delete after sometime there. If no one picks them up. So, what I was thinking about just adding them again and next to that I want to build up. Prototype with all the stuff we discussed and just have that as a Shareable document Shareable prototype. So anyone can view that and out of that prototype, we can also set up issues and for those issues, we can set up bounties as well.

Denis Lelic:  Yeah. If we.

Denis Lelic:  Anyone wants to add anything or we can. Just continue with the GPU landing page.

Denis Lelic:  Arthur, how do you feel about your first contribution?

Emmanuel Arthur: Actually, I was still engaged as a friend in Engineer. You need to explore more Tools with that. You can make it ideally as best. I wasn't familiar with Hugo, I need to learn more about Google so that I can contribute to I guess. So that I'm feeling It great about it is actually, the Greece is great,…

00:05:00

Denis Lelic: If that's great.

Emmanuel Arthur: and I really like it. Is I'm ready to contribute to Akash

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I think everyone needs some time. I know, Luna would agree like everyone needed some time to Get to know the who go and everything around it and probably when you when you get familiar, with that environment, it's much easier to work out of the other stuff that comes up.

Denis Lelic:  Okay, let's start with the GPU landing page. Tyler, Is there any essential stuff that this page should include? Is there any anything laid out already?

Tyler Wright: There isn't really at a high level, you know, we're about to jump into, you know, like first, we did some overclock labs. Did some internal testing of the feature, make sure that GPUs worked it did work, then, we opened it up to The insiders so people have been around in the community for a long time. They've been talking about GPUs and folks like Shimpa were able to bring GPU providers on we're able to test various deployments and so that worked Now, the goal is to get a wider range of folks that are testing. You know, GPUs both on the supply side and testing different, deep AI models, that leverage GPUs. And so

Tyler Wright:  This is a more wide raging effort that we want to involve obviously a number of people from the community the active community right now. Like folks that join a special interest groups and working groups and our insiders. But also folks that may not know that much about Akash um or folks that just know Kubernetes and again want to learn more Uh, this is an incentivized, testing it so there will be a number of tasks. Both on the supply side of like, again bringing up a GPU provider that'll be incentivized as well as on the demand side of like running various models. And

Tyler Wright:  Testing Other Out, Testing Other Tasks Inside the, Inside the Testnet, Whether it's being deploying CPUs or deploying GPUs, there's a number of tasks that we're asking folks to complete to put the test that through rigor, you know. So when we move to a main net, everything is like battle tested. So a high level those two paths are the paths that we're trying to get people to go down, right like a supply path and then the demand path and so like instructions on how to set up a provider you know that we've already shared on discord and twitter. We want to make those available on this page as well as. Again, on the

Tyler Wright:  demand Side, You know, just access for people to understand, maybe what the tasks are or what kind of task we're looking to do, you know, if we don't want to provide the task prior to the actual tests, that's starting, another thing that we want to do is take in Collect email addresses. We have sendgrid which is an again Open source tool managed by OVERCLOCK, but it's again available to the entire Akash community, which is just, like, people that sign up to learn more about The Akash network. And so anybody that comes to this specific GPU landing page. We would like to take in some of that information if at all possible. So that would just be like a set grade quick link.

Denis Lelic: But thanks. Yeah, go ahead.

Tyler Wright:  When I'll go ahead. I was just going to say When the tasks are are available. You do want to make a table that lets people know what the task is what the incentive related to that task is and then instructions connected to that task. You also want to let folks know how to Submit. So once you complete a task, there will be submission requirements for completing that task that make you eligible for the incentive. And so, Access to the submission form would be great and submission requirements. That's another great call because again because we the submissions and incentives are an Akt

00:10:00

Tyler Wright:  There's a requirement for us to KYC, AML anybody that receives incentives? So anybody can participate in the testnet. But if you again, if you want to receive incentives, in Akt, it does require KYC AML which will be done at the end of the process for those that successfully complete tasks.

Tyler Wright: I think the only thing I'm missing is maybe when it is again we'll have more dates to the goal, is to bring on supply right now. So You know we'll send out more wide-ranging messaging soon but we have been talking to a number of people in discord like shimpa like the prey to our team. Other insiders vanguards and core developers. about the incentive structure for supply, as we look to bring on A number of consumer grade, GPU chips and data, centigrade GPU trip. So, a100 a40s. And then again on the consumer side, anything 30 90, or three thousand series and up,

Tyler Wright: yeah, there are some h100s available so if somebody wants to bring those on to the network, For sure, we can tell. We want to test those

Denis Lelic: Okay, regarding the this page is this.

Denis Lelic:  Let's have a look. how Smart Network, for example, it's a page on its own so it's not part of any Any items here in the, in the menu.

Denis Lelic:  So it's probably going to be Akash.network slash GPU testnet.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, and it'd be great if it was even the navigation bar on the homepage. So one click from the homepage people can access the page you know if they come if they're you know, every also great if it was possible to make it A button or make the OR make that call to action stand out in the navigation bar. This is just my thoughts up. Anybody else has thought again, feel free to chime in anytime.

Denis Lelic: I think there's an option to I think I saw it a while ago, there's like a bar here. Above this menu bar. The main menu bar and it just has a message and we can add a call to action there. Like, To have a look at the this page, we're discussing. So I just hope that down like having access to GPU GPU page at the top of the Akash website or whatever. It's called to action.

Denis Lelic:  I did someone erase their hand?

Tyler Wright: Now, Luna had to head out. so don't

Denis Lelic:  Okay.

Denis Lelic:  so, this page is probably going to live before the GPU testnet and probably a couple of days after the AND

Denis Lelic:  it's not something we're going to have their permanently.

Denis Lelic:  And it's also probably a one pager.

Denis Lelic: Right.

Tyler Wright: So I was unmute. Um yeah I think it's a one pager. It could be multiple pages if you want to. talk about like different paths so like a supply path and the demand path, but that could also just live on one page with like, Kind of quick links to specific areas.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I was Yeah, I was thinking about just maybe duplicating the token page. And we can.

Denis Lelic: Structure. On the right side, we could have. X.

Denis Lelic:  And there's also a possibility to add a sub page like here for the faq's.

00:15:00

Tyler Wright: I love that. I love the FAQs. I love the sections on the right. I do think that middle section is kind of tech savvy. So I I would love to incorporate some imagery. If at all possible.

Denis Lelic:  Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I think. Yeah but just looking from the

Denis Lelic:  The best way to. Have this setup with like minimum friction.

Denis Lelic:  Arthur do you have any ideas like what do you think? I copying for example, the akit that the token page and just using this structure For the GPU. Testnet.

Denis Lelic:  Is this something you could handle?

Emmanuel Arthur: Yes. Yes, actually. Just put it on the design but you think send me the design so that I can have a look at by the design and talk about it.

Denis Lelic: Cool. And Tyler. Do we have any deadlines here?

Tyler Wright: yeah, this is does have a tight deadline because we would like, to start pushing people to This page as early as possible. Um, I think.

Emmanuel Arthur: so, so I'm going to stop the development of the main website so that you can add this one.

Denis Lelic:  so, next week,

Tyler Wright:  Yeah, that would be great. I mean, if we could turn this around, I don't know what people's timelines, but if it turns around by Thursday in a first draft standpoint. That'd be great because I think every if we could turn around and make it live on Friday, I think people would be. Very happy.

Emmanuel Arthur:  Okay.

Tyler Wright:  Because again, we want to spend a couple weeks to like push people to this page before we start the testnet.

Emmanuel Arthur:  But okay.

Denis Lelic: okay, but we still need some At least some content drafts, and maybe a visual for the for the page. So Arthur can have something to work with. I mean, it's easy to duplicate this one but we need some something to Build with. So we need some content and some imagery.

Tyler Wright: Yeah, I think. Denis, if you could structure out with like a kind of placeholder boxes for different pieces of content, I like I think it should be image at the top and then either like two paths kind of probably have other page set up where they're like kind of been a tile. um, or…

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright: whatever you think that's a little bit more visual and then For the FAQ just set it up and I will make sure that the content should be just like plug and play that should be dropped. But if we can set the structure, By end of day today or early tomorrow, then I can drop in the copy somewhere.

Tyler Wright:  Yeah, for both. Arthur, and you Denis.

Denis Lelic: Yeah. Yeah, I can work work with.

Denis Lelic:  dummy, text and just having some place holders there and I guess based on that, Arthur can set up.

Denis Lelic:  This page. Arthur, do you agree with this? Or do you want to add something to this?

Emmanuel Arthur: Yes, yes actually. I do agree. Actually just going with the design and use the damage test and send me the distance so that I can work on it.

Denis Lelic:  Sure.

Denis Lelic:  I wanted to add something but I just slipped my mind. So Oh yeah. Arthur. What time zone are you in?

Denis Lelic:  What time is there?

Emmanuel Arthur: Um, actually.

Emmanuel Arthur: I'm UTC. Itc0.

Denis Lelic:  Okay.

Denis Lelic:  What time is there now?

Emmanuel Arthur:  I thought it 355 pm.

Denis Lelic:  Okay, cool.

Denis Lelic: I could probably set up the design files. I'll see if I can do them tonight so you can have them tomorrow morning. Or I can just I can just start really early in the morning and…

Emmanuel Arthur:  Okay.

Denis Lelic: when you wake up, you're gonna have the files and we're going to be able to work with.

00:20:00

Emmanuel Arthur:  Okay.

Denis Lelic:  Cool.

Denis Lelic:  I'll just leave where I have some notes here and just gonna think about them. Try to structure. The page around these notes. And so, anyone who who's gonna be in charge of the content is gonna just, hopefully just bring in a headlines, the body copy and sub headlines, and stuff like that. And we can I'm thinking about having just one Cool image like a campaign image GPU testnet at the top and the rest of the content just follows.

Tyler Wright: That makes sense to me.

Denis Lelic: If you have anything else, you would like to add.

Tyler Wright:  Oh no. Not at this time. Yeah, I appreciate again the efforts like collaborating with the folks in this working group. So please again, don't be shy about Sharing any thoughts comments? Etc.

Denis Lelic:  Yeah, I'm just looking for prototype.

Denis Lelic:  a GPU related, but it's I think it's this one. Yeah, this part here. Tyler. I don't know if you can see my screen.

Tyler Wright: Yes, I can.

Denis Lelic:  Yeah, so currently at the At the homepage. There's like a bunch of groups with content.

Denis Lelic:  Listed basically just groups of content listed there. So me and Arthur were thinking about how to Divide that into a bit more like visually appealing and also easier to consume content. So we have these three groups and All of these. Smaller groups are dedicated to on the left. So we set up this prototype and I think Arthur's successfully put it together. So basically when you scroll down you just go through these groups here but you can easily switch between

Denis Lelic: The smaller groups by clicking here on the, on the headline groups on the left.

Tyler Wright:  Excellent.

Denis Lelic:  Yeah, and there's also Arthur took care of like a minor UI polishing stuff. For example, the the menu is now centered. The icons are updated. The illustrations here are updated. A great work, Arthur.

Tyler Wright:  Thank you. Arthur can Denis, can you go to the community page real fast?

Denis Lelic:  Right.

Emmanuel Arthur: Yes, yes, actually, I can go there. I can go to the community.

Tyler Wright:  Okay, perfect. All right, on the community page and Denis has it up on the screen right now. If you look at the Core Community group and you bring down so that the Core community groups Tab on the left hand side Denis.

Tyler Wright:  Perfect and you click on one of those working groups.

Denis Lelic: Yeah.

Tyler Wright:  I don't know if your screen is frozen Denis.

Tyler Wright: Okay, you might be frozen…

Denis Lelic: Started and…

Tyler Wright: because like

Denis Lelic: it didn't open. Ah, here it is.

Tyler Wright: I think you might be. I can't,…

Denis Lelic:  You hear me?

Tyler Wright: I can hear every other word, but it might just be me.

Tyler Wright: Okay, here we…

Denis Lelic: Maybe I'd just need to switch to my mobile.

Tyler Wright: I see I see now on the left hand side. Yeah. Okay, perfect. So you have a client, libraries working group. This does not match up with the data that's in the client. Libraries working group repo. Not really sure as to why that's happening. But Arthur, if you could look at that on the backend and github, that would be very, that would be great. The idea is as Like George or myself or envy or somebody else in the community updates notes. And updates one of the readme inside of like the community repo. It'd be great if this updated in pretty real time, whether it's an hour after or in real time, that would be ideal. But right now, it doesn't, it says, the last update is when can you go down to the bottom of this? Page.

00:25:00

Tyler Wright:  Last update was April. 16 18.

Tyler Wright: Yeah. So I'm not really sure what's causing it to modify and…

Denis Lelic: 18th.

Tyler Wright: when when it does but that would be something that would be very helpful. To know.

Emmanuel Arthur: Yes, actually. I think this issue was to read and get up there. But my main focus was creating the community so that you guys can see my contribution. So I will look into that. And see if I can work on that and serve the issue there.

Tyler Wright: Perfect. Yeah, that would be great. That's low priority compared to the GPU landing page, which is very high priority.

Emmanuel Arthur:  You okay?

Tyler Wright: But just like I just wanted to take this session to talk about it. one more thing, one more thing real quick, and I'm going to turn off these

Emmanuel Arthur:  but,

Tyler Wright: the specs moving forward, but if you go to Github and you go to the website repo, And you go to issues. um, and this goes for, Denis as well. If you go to closed issues, that'll be all the issues that like have gone stale and you could just reopen them. So instead of having to create it from scratch,…

Emmanuel Arthur:  Okay.

Tyler Wright: you could just reopen the issue and then you don't have to replicate some of that work.

Tyler Wright:  Who Denis Holland off your frozen, but you're very red right now.

Denis Lelic: Yeah, I don't know what's going on with my connection today. It's pretty bad. So sorry about that. I,

Tyler Wright: No worries, no.

Denis Lelic:  And see. And see what's up there.

Tyler Wright:  No worries.

Denis Lelic:  Yeah, there's a lot of issues in the pipeline and also improvements and new additions new pages. So but my goal is like to create a bunch of issues. But also to have an example, how does solution looks like and support that with a prototype. So anyone who's willing to take, A challenge and solve an issue.

Denis Lelic:  Could you just go through the prototype and see what? Exactly should be done and how it looks. I know me and Arthur. Did the same for the home page. And Arthur also requested to have. A prototype on example, how it should look like and it all, I agree with it. Also reduces the amount of discussions, the amount of questions that are raised. You know, not, everything is possible in prototype. But at least, if we get it like tonight ninety percent, it's gonna be quite obvious. That's what exactly should be done.

Denis Lelic: And that's something we should also take care. and for example, The console is pretty much out there. The new features. Are added, but not that often by. I think we have a lot more work and cleaning up and adding up adding new stuff for the website, then the console. So, Yeah.

Zach Horn: Hey, sorry,…

Denis Lelic: Hey Zach.

Zach Horn: I'm a little late just jumping over from Greg's lives Twitter spaces.

Denis Lelic:  Are cool. Yeah, we were just because discussing the GPU landing page.

Zach Horn:  Cool. What you what do we what do we have so far?

Denis Lelic: Yeah, we're just discussed about the essential stuff. The page should include. So Tyler mentioned, like supply and demand.

00:30:00

Denis Lelic:  so supply, like For a supplies. Dedicated for Providers. We should have like some sort of instructions how to set up environments.

Denis Lelic:  and to set up leases and for the demand side we should take care of like and provide a list of tasks and form some sort of a table and add, what kind of reward is

Denis Lelic:  Belongs to us to a specific task.

Zach Horn: that if we're having people come to this landing page, I think we need to put a lot of thought behind. Do we want to give them the information to get started at that point in time? Or do we want them to go through a flow where they're giving us their email address? And we're sending them to discord before they get that information because the way it's set up. Now it looks like they're gonna hit this landing page and get most of the info. They need to get started. Before we ever have a touch point with them to either send them an email or have them come into discord. I don't I don't necessarily know today with the right answer. There is I'm kind of leaning towards having at least one like communication touch point with them before they get that info. But also I do know that we
