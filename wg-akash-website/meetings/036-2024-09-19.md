## Meeting Notes

- **PRs and Feedback on Ecosystem Updates**

  - Piyush mentioned two new PRs from Alice: one involves adding new content to the site, and the other is focused on ecosystem recommendations.
  - Tyler suggested that, for efficiency, PRs should be merged promptly to avoid delaying additional work and feedback from Zach will be sought in person due to the busy conference schedule.
